abstract = {The yeast amphiphysin homologue Rvs167p plays a role in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, and sporulation. Rvs167p is a phosphoprotein in vegetatively growing cells and shows increased phosphorylation upon treatment with mating pheromone. Previous work has shown that Rvs167p can be phosphorylated in vitro by the cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85p complexed with its cyclin Pcl2p. Using chymotryptic phosphopeptide mapping, we have identified the sites on which Rvs167p is phosphorylated in vitro by Pcl2p-Pho85p. We have shown that these same sites are phosphorylated in vivo during vegetative growth and that phosphorylation at two of these sites is Pcl-Pho85p dependent. In cells treated with mating pheromone, the MAP kinase Fus3p is needed for full phosphorylation of Rvs167p. Functional genomics and genetics experiments revealed that mutation of other actin cytoskeleton genes compromises growth of a strain in which phosphorylation of Rvs167p is blocked by mutation. Phosphorylation of Rvs167p inhibits its interaction in vitro with Las17p, an activator of the Arp2/3 complex, as well as with a novel protein, Ymr192p. Our results suggest that phosphorylation of Rvs167p by a cyclin-dependent kinase and by a MAP kinase is an important mechanism for regulating protein complexes involved in actin cytoskeleton function.},

abstract = {Mutations in RVS161 and RVS167 yeast genes induce identical phenotypes associated to actin cytoskeleton disorders. The whole Rvs161 protein is similar to the amino-terminal part of Rvs167p, thus defining a RVS domain. In addition to this domain, Rvs167p contains a central glycine-proline-alanine rich domain and a SH3 domain. To assess the function of these different domains we have expressed recombinant Rvs proteins in rvs mutant strains. Phenotype analysis has shown that the RVS and SH3 domains are necessary for phenotypical complementation, whereas the GPA domain is not. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the RVS domains from Rvs161p and Rvs167p have distinct roles, and that the SH3 domain needs the specific RVS domain of Rvs167p to function. These results suggest that Rvs161p and Rvs167p play distinct roles, while acting together in a common function.},

abstract = {The Bin1/amphiphysin/Rvs167 (BAR) domain proteins are a ubiquitous protein family. Genes encoding members of this family have not yet been found in the genomes of prokaryotes, but within eukaryotes, BAR domain proteins are found universally from unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast through to plants, insects, and vertebrates. BAR domain proteins share an N-terminal BAR domain with a high propensity to adopt $\alpha$-helical structure and engage in coiled-coil interactions with other proteins. BAR domain proteins are implicated in processes as fundamental and diverse as fission of synaptic vesicles, cell polarity, endocytosis, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, transcriptional repression, cell-cell fusion, signal transduction, apoptosis, secretory vesicle fusion, excitation-contraction coupling, learning and memory, tissue differentiation, ion flux across membranes, and tumor suppression. What has been lacking is a molecular understanding of the role of the BAR domain protein in each process. The three-dimensional structure of the BAR domain has now been determined and valuable insight has been gained in understanding the interactions of BAR domains with membranes. The cellular roles of BAR domain proteins, characterized over the past decade in cells as distinct as yeasts, neurons, and myocytes, can now be understood in terms of a fundamental molecular function of all BAR domain proteins: to sense membrane curvature, to bind GTPases, and to mold a diversity of cellular membranes.},

abstract = {During hyperosmotic shock, Saccharomyces cerevisiae adjusts to physiological challenges, including large plasma membrane invaginations generated by rapid cell shrinkage. Calcineurin, the Ca2+/calmodulin–dependent phosphatase, is normally cytosolic but concentrates in puncta and at sites of polarized growth during intense osmotic stress; inhibition of calcineurin-activated gene expression suggests that restricting its access to substrates tunes calcineurin signaling specificity. Hyperosmotic shock promotes calcineurin binding to and dephosphorylation of the PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase synaptojanin/Inp53/Sjl3 and causes dramatic calcineurin-dependent reorganization of PI(4,5)P2-enriched membrane domains. Inp53 normally promotes sorting at the trans-Golgi network but localizes to cortical actin patches in osmotically stressed cells. By activating Inp53, calcineurin repolarizes the actin cytoskeleton and maintains normal plasma membrane morphology in synaptojanin-limited cells. In response to hyperosmotic shock and calcineurin-dependent regulation, Inp53 shifts from associating predominantly with clathrin to interacting with endocytic proteins Sla1, Bzz1, and Bsp1, suggesting that Inp53 mediates stress-specific endocytic events. This response has physiological and molecular similarities to calcineurin-regulated activity-dependent bulk endocytosis in neurons, which retrieves a bolus of plasma membrane deposited by synaptic vesicle fusion. We propose that activation of Ca2+/calcineurin and PI(4,5)P2 signaling to regulate endocytosis is a fundamental and conserved response to excess membrane in eukaryotic cells.},

abstract = {Endocytosis, the process whereby the plasma membrane invaginates to form vesicles, is essential for bringing many substances into the cell and for membrane turnover. The mechanism driving clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) involves {\textgreater} 50 different protein components assembling at a single location on the plasma membrane in a temporally ordered and hierarchal pathway. These proteins perform precisely choreographed steps that promote receptor recognition and clustering, membrane remodeling, and force-generating actin-filament assembly and turnover to drive membrane invagination and vesicle scission. Many critical aspects of the CME mechanism are conserved from yeast to mammals and were first elucidated in yeast, demonstrating that it is a powerful system for studying endocytosis. In this review, we describe our current mechanistic understanding of each step in the process of yeast CME, and the essential roles played by actin polymerization at these sites, while providing a historical perspective of how the landscape has changed since the preceding version of the YeastBook was published 17 years ago (1997). Finally, we discuss the key unresolved issues and where future studies might be headed.},

AtxA caused changes in the dynamics of vesicle formation and scission from the plasma membrane in a phospholipase activity dependent manner. Our data, based on synthetic dosage lethality screen and the analysis of the dynamics of sites of endocytosis, indicate that AtxA impairs the activity of amphiphysin.ConclusionsWe identified amphiphysin and endocytosis as the target of AtxA intracellular activity. We propose that AtxA reduces endocytosis following a mechanism of action which includes both a specific protein–protein interaction and enzymatic activity, and which is applicable to yeast and mammalian cells. Knowing how neurotoxic phospholipases A2 work can open new ways to regulate endocytosis.},

@article{Soulard2002,
abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

abstract = {SNX33 (sorting nexin 33) is a homologue of the endocytic protein SNX9 and has been implicated in actin polymerization and the endocytosis of the amyloid precursor protein. SNX33 belongs to the large family of BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain-containing proteins, which alter cellular protein trafficking by modulating cellular membranes and the cytoskeleton. Some BAR domains engage in homodimerization, whereas other BAR domains also mediate heterodimerization between different BAR domain-containing proteins. The molecular basis for this difference is not yet understood. Using co-immunoprecipitations we report that SNX33 forms homodimers, but not heterodimers, with other BAR domain-containing proteins, such as SNX9. Domain deletion analysis revealed that the BAR domain, but not the SH3 (Src homology 3) domain, was required for homodimerization of SNX33. Additionally, the BAR domain prevented the heterodimerization between SNX9 and SNX33, as determined by domain swap experiments. Molecular modelling of the SNX33 BAR domain structure revealed that key amino acids located at the BAR domain dimer interface of the SNX9 homodimer are not conserved in SNX33. Replacing these amino acids in SNX9 with the corresponding amino acids of SNX33 allowed the mutant SNX9 to heterodimerize with SNX33. Taken together, the present study identifies critical amino acids within the BAR domains of SNX9 and SNX33 as determinants for the specificity of BAR domain-mediated interactions and suggests that SNX9 and SNX33 have distinct molecular functions.},

abstract = {Amphiphysins, members of the BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvsp) protein super family, have been postulated to play a key role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs). This review focuses on recent genetic studies of the role of amphiphysins in SV recycling and membrane morphogenesis. In the mouse, brain-specific amphiphysin I and II regulate, but are not essential for, SV recycling. The role of this regulation appears important, as mice deficient in these proteins have seizures and are deficient in learning and memory. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, amphiphysin is found in muscles and is enriched at postsynaptic membranes of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs); however, it does not play a role in SV recycling. Rather, amphiphysin in fly muscles appears to regulate the organization and structure of the muscle T-tubule system and possibly the subsynaptic reticulum. Amphiphysin is also involved in membrane organization in both neurons and non-neuronal cells in Drosophila. These studies reveal pleiotropic functions for amphiphysins in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the regulation of membrane dynamics, perhaps through the actin cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {Morphological changes during cell division in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are controlled by cell-cycle regulators. The Pcl-Pho85p kinase complex has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton at least in part through Rvs167p. Rvs167p consists of three domains called BAR, GPA, and SH3. Using a two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that each region of Rvs167p participates in protein-protein interactions: the BAR domain bound the BAR domain of another Rvs167p protein and that of Rvs161p, the GPA region bound Pcl2p, and the SH3 domain bound Abp1p. We identified Rvs167p as a Las17p/Bee1p-interacting protein in a two-hybrid screen and showed that Las17p/Bee1p bound the SH3 domain of Rvs167p. We tested the extent to which the Rvs167p protein domains rescued phenotypes associated with deletion of RVS167: salt sensitivity, random budding, and endocytosis and sporulation defects. The BAR domain was sufficient for full or partial rescue of all rvs167 mutant phenotypes tested but not required for the sporulation defect for which the SH3 domain was also sufficient. Overexpression of Rvs167p inhibits cell growth. The BAR domain was essential for this inhibition and the SH3 domain had only a minor effect. Rvs167p may link the cell cycle regulator Pcl-Pho85p kinase and the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that Rvs167p is activated by phosphorylation in its GPA region by the Pcl-Pho85p kinase. Upon activation, Rvs167p enters a multiprotein complex, making critical contacts in its BAR domain and redundant or minor contacts with its SH3 domain.},

abstract = {Cells are populated by a vast array of membrane-binding proteins that execute critical functions. Functions, like signaling and intracellular transport, require the abilities to bind to highly curved membranes and to trigger membrane deformation. Among these proteins is amphiphysin 1, implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It contains a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs membrane-binding domain with an N-terminal amphipathic helix that senses and generates membrane curvature. However, an understanding of the parameters distinguishing these two functions is missing. By pulling a highly curved nanotube of controlled radius from a giant vesicle in a solution containing amphiphysin, we observed that the action of the protein depends directly on its density on the membrane. At low densities of protein on the nearly flat vesicle, the distribution of proteins and the mechanical effects induced are described by a model based on spontaneous curvature induction. The tube radius and force are modified by protein binding but still depend on membrane tension. In the dilute limit, when practically no proteins were present on the vesicle, no mechanical effects were detected, but strong protein enrichment proportional to curvature was seen on the tube. At high densities, the radius is independent of tension and vesicle protein density, resulting from the formation of a scaffold around the tube. As a consequence, the scaling of the force with tension is modified. For the entire density range, protein was enriched on the tube as compared to the vesicle. Our approach shows that the strength of curvature sensing and mechanical effects on the tube depends on the protein density.},

abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton cells is altered in rvs161 mutant yeast, with the defect becoming more pronounced under unfavorable growth conditions, as described for the rvs167 mutant. The cytoskeletal alteration has no apparent effect on invertase secretion and polarized growth. Mutations in RTVS161, just as in RI/S167, lead to a random budding pattern in a/$\alpha$ diploid cells. This behavior is not observed in a/a diploid cells homozygous for the rvs161-1 or rvs167-1 mutations. In addition, sequence comparisons revealed that amphiphysin, a protein first found in synaptic vesicles of chicken and shown to be the autoantigen of Stiff Man syndrome, presents similarity with both Rvs proteins. Furthermore, limited similarities with myosin heavy chain and tropomyosin alpha chain from higher eukaryotic cells allow for the definition of a possible consensus sequence. The finding of related sequences suggests the existence of a function for these proteins that is conserved among eukaryotic organisms.},

However, the timing of its formation and turnover, and its specific functions at different stages during endocytic internalization, have not been established. In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics during endocytosis in yeast. Our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels increase and decline in conjunction with coat and actin assembly and disassembly, respectively. Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

We found that unlike some forms of amphiphysin, Rvs161p-Rvs167p acts as an obligate heterodimer during vegetative growth and neither Rvs161p nor Rvs167p forms a homodimer in vivo. RVS161 and RVS167 have an identical set of 49 synthetic lethal interactions, revealing functions for the Rvs proteins in cell polarity, cell wall synthesis, and vesicle trafficking as well as a shared role in mating. Consistent with these roles, we show that the Rvs167p-Rvs161p heterodimer, like its amphiphysin homologues, can bind to phospholipid membranes in vitro, suggesting a role in vesicle formation and/or fusion. Our genetic screens also reveal that the interaction between Abp1p and the Rvs167p Src homology 3 (SH3) domain may be important under certain conditions, providing the first genetic evidence for a role for the SH3 domain of Rvs167p. Our studies implicate heterodimerization of amphiphysin family proteins in various functions related to cell polarity, cell integrity, and vesicle trafficking during vegetative growth and the mating response.},

The actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex, and there is growing evidence that F-actin plays a direct role in these endocytic events. Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process. Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide powerful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites. In this review, we focus on progress made in elucidating the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis.},

The mutant exhibits the same response when cells are grown in high salt concentrations and other unfavorable growth conditions. The RVS167 gene product displays significant homology with the Rvs161 protein and contains a SH3 domain at the C-terminal end. Abnormal actin distribution is associated with the mutant phenotype. In addition, while the budding pattern of haploid strains remains axial in standard growth conditions, the budding pattern of diploid mutant strains is random.

Similarly, the level of Rvs161p is strongly reduced in an rvs167$\Delta$ strain. We demonstrate that these reduced protein levels at steady state are due to a decreased stability of either Rvs protein in the absence of the other protein. Furthermore, we find that the amount and ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for receptor-mediated endocytosis.

Rvs167 and Rvs161, the yeast homologs of amphiphysin I, have been implicated in endocytosis, actin function, and cell polarity. Now we have explored the possibility that amphiphysin I also may have a role in actin dynamics and cell polarity by testing the effect of amphiphysin I suppression on neurite outgrowth. Freshly plated hippocampal neurons were exposed to antisense oligonucleotides via a new delivery system based on a polycationic amphipathic polymer, PS980. Western blot analysis revealed that amphiphysin I levels steadily increased with neuronal differentiation, whereas in antisense-treated cultures amphiphysin I levels were reduced to approximately 10{\%} of control levels at 48 hr. Concomitantly, a collapse of growth cones and a severe inhibition of neurite outgrowth and axon formation were observed. A similar effect was observed previously after dynamin I suppression in the same culture system (). We also have found that amphiphysin I and dynamin I colocalize in developing neurons at all developmental stages and that a pool of both proteins is colocalized with actin patches at the leading edge of growth cones. Our findings suggest a conserved role of the amphiphysin protein family in the dynamics of the cortical cell cytoskeleton and provide new evidence for a close functional link between amphiphysin I and dynamin I.},

abstract = {During endocytosis, energy is invested to narrow the necks of cargo-containing plasma membrane invaginations to radii at which the opposing segments spontaneously coalesce, thereby leading to the detachment by scission of endocytic uptake carriers. In the clathrin pathway, dynamin uses mechanical energy from GTP hydrolysis to this effect, assisted by the BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain-containing protein endophilin. Clathrin-independent endocytic events are often less reliant on dynamin, and whether in these cases BAR domain proteins such as endophilin contribute to scission has remained unexplored. Here we show, in human and other mammalian cell lines, that endophilin-A2 (endoA2) specifically and functionally associates with very early uptake structures that are induced by the bacterial Shiga and cholera toxins, which are both clathrin-independent endocytic cargoes. In controlled in vitro systems, endoA2 reshapes membranes before scission. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endoA2, dynamin and actin contribute in parallel to the scission of Shiga-toxin-induced tubules. Our results establish a novel function of endoA2 in clathrin-independent endocytosis.

abstract = {Fluorescence live-cell imaging has temporally resolved the conserved choreography of more than 30 proteins involved in clathrin and actin-mediated endocytic budding from the plasma membrane. However, the resolution of these studies is insufficient to unveil how the endocytic machinery actually drives membrane deformation in vivo. In this study, we use quantitative immuno-EM to introduce the temporal dimension to the ultrastructural analysis of membrane budding and define changes in the topography of the lipid bilayer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Using this approach, we frame the emergence of membrane curvature with respect to the recruitment of endocytic factors and show that constriction of the invaginations correlates with translocation of membrane-sculpting proteins. Furthermore, we show that initial bending of the plasma membrane is independent of actin and clathrin polymerization and precedes building of an actin cap branched by the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, our data indicate that constriction and additional elongation of the endocytic profiles require the mechanochemical activity of the myosins-I. Altogether, this work provides major insights into the molecular mechanisms driving membrane deformation in a cellular context.},

However, here we report that the membrane-sculpting F-BAR domain–containing Fer/Cip4 homology domain-only proteins 1 and 2 (FCHo1/2) were required for plasma membrane clathrin-coated vesicle (CCV) budding and marked sites of CCV formation. Changes in FCHo1/2 expression levels correlated directly with numbers of CCV budding events, ligand endocytosis, and synaptic vesicle marker recycling. FCHo1/2 proteins bound specifically to the plasma membrane and recruited the scaffold proteins eps15 and intersectin, which in turn engaged the adaptor complex AP2. The FCHo F-BAR membrane-bending activity was required, leading to the proposal that FCHo1/2 sculpt the initial bud site and recruit the clathrin machinery for CCV formation.},

abstract = {Sla1 and Rvs167 are yeast proteins required for receptor internalization and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Here we provide evidence that Sla1 and Rvs167 are orthologues of the mammalian CIN85 and endophilin proteins, respectively, which are required for ligand-stimulated growth factor receptor internalization. Sla1 is similar in domain structure to CIN85 and binds directly to the endophilin-like Rvs167. Akin to CIN85, Sla1 interacts with synaptojanins and a ubiquitin ligase that regulates endocytosis. This ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5, binds directly to both Sla1 and Rvs167. The interaction between Rsp5 and Rvs167 is mediated through Rsp5 WW domains and PXY motifs in the central Gly-Pro-Ala-rich domain of Rvs167. Rvs167 PXY motifs are required for Rsp5-dependent monoubiquitination of Rvs167 on Lys481 in the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. Mutation of Lys481 → Arg causes cells to grow slowly on medium containing 1 m NaCl, although this phenotype is not due to the defect in ubiquitination caused by the K481R mutation. We propose that Rsp5 interaction with Sla1-Rvs167 promotes Rvs167 ubiquitination and regulates activity of this protein complex. Rvs167 ubiquitination is not required for general function of Rvs167, but may control specific Rvs167 SH3 domain-protein interactions or negatively regulate SH3 domain activity.},

It is a dominant autoantigen in patients with stiff-man syndrome associated with breast cancer, as well as in other paraneoplastic autoimmune neurological disorders. To elucidate the connection between amphiphysin I autoimmunity and cancer, we investigated its expression in breast cancer tissue. We report that amphiphysin I was expressed as two isoforms of 128 and 108 kD in the breast cancer of a patient with anti-amphiphysin I antibodies and paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy. Amphiphysin I was also detectable at variable levels in several other human breast cancer tissues and cell lines and at low levels in normal mammary tissue and a variety of other non-neuronal tissues. The predominant amphiphysin I isoform expressed outside the brain in humans is the 108 kD isoform which represents an alternatively spliced variant of neuronal amphiphysin I missing a 42 amino acid insert. Our study suggests a link between amphiphysin I expression in cancer and amphiphysin I autoimmunity. The enhanced expression of amphiphysin I in some forms of cancer supports the hypothesis that amphiphysin family members may play a role in the biology of cancer cells.},

abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae synaptojanin-like proteins (Sjl1, Sjl2, and Sjl3) are phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatases that regulate PI metabolism in the control of actin organization and membrane trafficking. However, the primary sites of action for each of the yeast synaptojanin-like proteins remain unclear. In this study, we show that Sjl2 is localized to cortical actin patches, sites of endocytosis. Cortical recruitment of Sjl2 requires the actin patch component Abp1. Consistent with this, the SH3 domain-containing protein Abp1 physically associates with Sjl2 through its proline-rich domain. Furthermore, abp1$\Delta$ mutations confer defects resembling loss of SJL2; sjl1$\Delta$ abp1$\Delta$ double-mutant cells exhibit invaginated plasma membranes and impaired endocytosis, findings similar to those for sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant cells. Thus, Abp1 acts as an adaptor protein in the localization or concentration of Sjl2 during late stages of endocytic vesicle formation. Overexpression of the Hip1-related protein Sla2 delayed the formation of extended plasma membrane invaginations in sjl2ts cells, indicating that Sla2 may become limiting or misregulated in cells with impaired PI phosphatase activity. Consistent with this, the cortical actin patch protein Sla2 is mislocalized in sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant cells. Together, our studies suggest that PI metabolism by the synaptojanin-like proteins coordinately directs actin dynamics and membrane invagination, in part by regulation of Sla2.},

While crystal structures of different BAR dimers advanced our understanding of membrane shaping by scaffolding and hydrophobic insertion mechanisms considerably, especially life‐imaging techniques and loss‐of‐function studies of clathrin‐mediated endocytosis with its gradually increasing curvature show that the initial idea that solely BAR domain curvatures determine their functions is oversimplified. Diagonal placing, lateral lipid‐binding modes, additional lipid‐binding modules, tilde shapes and formation of macromolecular lattices with different modes of organisation and arrangement increase versatility. A picture emerges, in which BAR domain proteins create macromolecular platforms, that recruit and connect different binding partners and ensure the connection and coordination of the different events during the endocytic process, such as membrane invagination, coat formation, actin nucleation, vesicle size control, fission, detachment and uncoating, in time and space, and may thereby offer mechanistic explanations for how coordination, directionality and effectiveness of a complex process with several steps and key players can be achieved.},

Core elements of the hierarchy are widely conserved, underlying cell polarity development in diverse eukaryotes. To enumerate more fully the protein–protein interactions that mediate cell polarity development, and to uncover novel mechanisms that coordinate the numerous events involved, we carried out a large-scale two-hybrid experiment. 68 Gal4 DNA binding domain fusions of yeast proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton, septins, the secretory apparatus, and Rho-type GTPases were used to screen an array of yeast transformants that express ∼90{\%} of the predicted Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frames as Gal4 activation domain fusions. 191 protein–protein interactions were detected, of which 128 had not been described previously. 44 interactions implicated 20 previously uncharacterized proteins in cell polarity development. Further insights into possible roles of 13 of these proteins were revealed by their multiple two-hybrid interactions and by subcellular localization. Included in the interaction network were associations of Cdc42 and Rho1 pathways with proteins involved in exocytosis, septin organization, actin assembly, microtubule organization, autophagy, cytokinesis, and cell wall synthesis. Other interactions suggested direct connections between Rho1- and Cdc42-regulated pathways; the secretory apparatus and regulators of polarity establishment; actin assembly and the morphogenesis checkpoint; and the exocytic and endocytic machinery. In total, a network of interactions that provide an integrated response of signaling proteins, the cytoskeleton, and organelles to the spatial cues that direct polarity development was revealed.},

ACAP1 (Arfgap with Coil coil, Ankyrin repeat, and PH domain protein 1) contains a BAR domain.

Specific residues within the PH domain are responsible for both membrane binding and curvature generation. The BAR domain adjacent to the PH domain instead interacts with the BAR domains of neighboring ACAP1 proteins to enable clustering at the membrane.

Correlative electron and fluorescence microscopy has the potential to elucidate the ultrastructural details of dynamic and rare cellular events, but has been limited by low precision and sensitivity. Here we present a method for direct mapping of signals originating from ∼20 fluorescent protein molecules to 3D electron tomograms with a precision of less than 100 nm. We demonstrate that this method can be used to identify individual HIV particles bound to mammalian cell surfaces. We also apply the method to image microtubule end structures bound to mal3p in fission yeast, and demonstrate that growing microtubule plus-ends are flared in vivo. We localize Rvs167 to endocytic sites in budding yeast, and show that scission takes place halfway through a 10-s time period during which amphiphysins are bound to the vesicle neck. This new technique opens the door for direct correlation of fluorescence and electron microscopy to visualize cellular processes at the ultrastructural scale.},

abstract = {The Rvs161p and Rvs167p proteins of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, homologues of higher eukaryotes' amphiphysins, associate with actin and appear to be involved in several functions related to the actin cytoskeleton. In order to identify partners of the Rvsp proteins, yeast libraries constructed in two-hybrid vectors were screened using either Rvs167p or Rvs161p as a bait. The selected candidates, representing 34 ORFs, were then tested against both Rvsp proteins, as well as domains of Rvs167p or Rvs161p. Among the most significant ones, 24 ORFs were specific preys of Rvs167p only and two gave interactions with Rvs161p only. Interestingly, five ORFs were preys of both Rvs161p and Rvs167p (RVS167, LAS17, YNL094w, YMR192w and YPL249c). Analysis of putative functions of the candidates confirm involvement of the Rvsp in endocytosis/vesicle traffic, but also opens possible new fields, such as nuclear functions.},

abstract = {BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) adapter proteins have been suggested to regulate endocytosis, actin organization, apoptosis, and transcription, but their precise roles are obscure. There are at least five mammalian genes that encode BAR adapter proteins, including the evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed Bin1/Amphiphysin-II and Bin3 genes. Bin1 holds special interest as certain splice isoforms localize to the nucleus, interact with the c-Abl and c-Myc oncoproteins, and display tumor suppressor properties. To obtain functional insights, we embarked upon a genetic analysis of the two BAR adapter proteins expressed in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In a previous work, a role in actin organization and cytokinesis was identified for the Bin3 homolog hob3+. In this study, a role in stress signaling was defined for the Bin1 homolog, hob1+. Notably, hob1+ was dispensable for endocytosis, actin organization, or osmotic sensitivity. Instead, mutation of hob1+ led to slight cell elongation and faulty cell cycle arrest upon nutrient starvation. These defects were complemented by Bin1, but not by Amphiphysin-I, arguing that these genes have distinct functions despite their structural similarity. hob1 delta mutant cells were also hypersensitive to genotoxic stress. This was not related to a faulty checkpoint response, but mutation in the checkpoint gene rad3(+) further exacerbated the sensitivity of hob1 delta mutant cells. Interestingly, mutation of the cell cycle regulator wee1+ partially relieved the sensitivity defect, suggesting that hob1+ may influence the efficiency of DNA repair or checkpoint release after DNA damage. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicated that hob3+ is epistatic to hob1+ in the response to genotoxic stress. Our findings indicate that the Bin1 homolog hob1+ participates in DNA damage signaling and they suggest a novel role for BAR adapter proteins in stress response processes.},

abstract = {Summary
Membrane remodeling by BAR (Bin, Amphiphysin, RVS) domain-containing proteins, such as endophilins and amphiphysins, is integral to the process of endocytosis. However, little is known about the regulation of endocytic BAR domain activity. We have identified an interaction between the yeast Rvs167 N-BAR domain and calmodulin. Calmodulin-binding mutants of Rvs167 exhibited defects in endocytic vesicle release. In vitro, calmodulin enhanced membrane tubulation and constriction by wild-type Rvs167 but not calmodulin-binding-defective mutants. A subset of mammalian N-BAR domains bound calmodulin, and co-expression of calmodulin with endophilin A2 potentiated tubulation in vivo. These studies reveal a conserved role for calmodulin in regulating the intrinsic membrane-sculpting activity of endocytic N-BAR domains.},

abstract = {Cellular proteins containing Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domains play a key role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Despite extensive structural and functional studies of BAR domains, it is still unknown how exactly these domains interact with the plasma membrane containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) and whether they function by a universal mechanism or by different mechanisms. Here we report that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) specifically induces partial membrane penetration of the N-terminal amphiphilic $\alpha$-helix (H(0)) of two representative N-BAR domains from Drosophila amphiphysin (dAmp-BAR) and rat endophilin A1 (EndoA1-BAR). Our quantitative fluorescence imaging analysis shows that PtdIns(4,5)P(2)-dependent membrane penetration of H(0) is important for self-association of membrane-bound dAmp-BAR and EndoA1-BAR and their membrane deformation activity. EndoA1-BAR behaves differently from dAmp-BAR because the former has an additional amphiphilic $\alpha$-helix that penetrates the membrane in a PtdIns(4,5)P(2)-independent manner. Depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) from the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells abrogated the membrane deforming activity of EndoA1-BAR and dAmp-BAR. Collectively, these studies suggest that the local PtdIns(4,5)P(2) concentration in the plasma membrane may regulate the membrane interaction and deformation by N-BAR domain-containing proteins during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.},

abstract = {Centronuclear myopathies are characterized by muscle weakness and abnormal centralization of nuclei in muscle fibers not secondary to regeneration. The severe neonatal X-linked form (myotubular myopathy) is due to mutations in the phosphoinositide phosphatase myotubularin (MTM1), whereas mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) have been found in some autosomal dominant cases. By direct sequencing of functional candidate genes, we identified homozygous mutations in amphiphysin 2 (BIN1) in three families with autosomal recessive inheritance. Two missense mutations affecting the BAR (Bin1/amphiphysin/RVS167) domain disrupt its membrane tubulation properties in transfected cells, and a partial truncation of the C-terminal SH3 domain abrogates the interaction with DNM2 and its recruitment to the membrane tubules. Our results suggest that mutations in BIN1 cause centronuclear myopathy by interfering with remodeling of T tubules and/or endocytic membranes, and that the functional interaction between BIN1 and DNM2 is necessary for normal muscle function and positioning of nuclei.},

abstract = {Endocytosis of receptors at the plasma membrane is controlled by a complex mechanism that includes clathrin, adaptors, and actin regulators. Many of these proteins are conserved in yeast yet lack observable mutant phenotypes, which suggests that yeast endocytosis may be subject to different regulatory mechanisms. Here, we have systematically defined genes required for internalization using a quantitative genome-wide screen that monitors localization of the yeast vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin homologue Snc1. Genetic interaction mapping was used to place these genes into functional modules containing known and novel endocytic regulators, and cargo selectivity was evaluated by an array-based comparative analysis. We demonstrate that clathrin and the yeast AP180 clathrin adaptor proteins have a cargo-specific role in Snc1 internalization. We additionally identify low dye binding 17 (LDB17) as a novel conserved component of the endocytic machinery. Ldb17 is recruited to cortical actin patches before actin polymerization and regulates normal coat dynamics and actin assembly. Our findings highlight the conserved machinery and reveal novel mechanisms that underlie endocytic internalization.},

abstract = {Dynamins are a conserved family of proteins involved in many membrane fusion and fission events. Previously, the dynamin-related protein Vps1 was shown to localize to endocytic sites, and yeast carrying deletions for genes encoding both the BAR domain protein Rvs167 and Vps1 had a more severe endocytic scission defect than either deletion alone. Vps1 and Rvs167 localize to endocytic sites at the onset of invagination and disassemble concomitant with inward vesicle movement. Rvs167-GFP localization is reduced in cells lacking vps1 suggesting that Vps1 influences Rvs167 association with the endocytic complex. Unlike classical dynamins, Vps1 does not have a proline–arginine domain that could interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins. Thus, while Rvs167 has an SH3 domain, it is not clear how an interaction would be mediated. Here, we demonstrate an interaction between Rvs167 SH3 domain and the single type ISH3-binding motif in Vps1. Mutant Vps1 that cannot bind Rvs167 rescues all membrane fusion/fission functions associated with Vps1 except for endocytic function, demonstrating the specificity and mechanistic importance of the interaction. In vitro, an Rvs161/Rvs167 heterodimer can disassemble Vps1 oligomers. Overall, the data support the idea that Vps1 and the amphiphysins function together to mediate scission during endocytosis in yeast.},

The process involves the formation of a putative FCH domain only (FCHO) initiation complex, which matures through adaptor protein 2 (AP2)-dependent cargo selection, and subsequent coat building, dynamin-mediated scission and finally auxilin- and heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70)-dependent uncoating.

abstract = {To explore the conservation of Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-mediated networks in evolution, we compared the specificity landscape of these domains among four yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ashbya gossypii, Candida albicans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, encompassing 400 million years of evolution. We first aligned and catalogued the families of SH3-containing proteins in these four species to determine the relationships between homologous domains. Then, we tagged and purified all soluble SH3 domains (82 in total) to perform a quantitative peptide assay (SPOT) for each SH3 domain. All SPOT readouts were hierarchically clustered and we observed that the organization of the SH3 specificity landscape in three distinct profile classes remains conserved across these four yeast species. We also produced a specificity profile for each SH3 domain from manually aligned top SPOT hits and compared the within-family binding motif consensus. This analysis revealed a striking example of binding motif divergence in a C. albicans Rvs167 paralog, which cannot be explained by overall SH3 sequence or interface residue divergence, and we validated this specificity change with a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay. In addition, we show that position-weighted matrices (PWM) compiled from SPOT assays can be used for binding motif screening in potential binding partners and present cases where motifs are either conserved or lost among homologous SH3 interacting proteins. Finally, by comparing pairwise SH3 sequence identity to binding profile correlation we show that for {\~{}}75{\%} of all analyzed families the SH3 specificity profile was remarkably conserved over a large evolutionary distance. Thus, a high sequence identity within an SH3 domain family predicts conserved binding specificity, whereas divergence in sequence identity often coincided with a change in binding specificity within this family. As such, our results are important for future studies aimed at unraveling complex specificity networks of peptide recognition domains in higher eukaryotes, including mammals.},

In Part I of this two-part commentary, presented in the previous issue of Journal of Cell Science, we discussed the basis by which yeast establishes and maintains different states of polarity through Ρ GTPases and cyclin-dependent protein kinase signaling. Here we discuss how, in response to those signals, the actin cytoskeleton guides growth of the yeast cell. A polarized array of actin cables at the cell cortex is the primary structural determinant of polarity. Motors such as class V myosins use this array to transport secretory vesicles, mRNA and organelles towards growth sites, where they are anchored by a cap of cytoskeletal and regulatory proteins. Cortical actin patches enhance and maintain this polarity, probably through endocytic recycling, which allows reuse of materials and prevents continued growth at old sites.

abstract = {Amphiphysin, a protein that is highly concentrated in nerve terminals, has been proposed to function as a linker between the clathrin coat and dynamin in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Here, using a cell-free system, we provide direct morphological evidence in support of this hypothesis. Unexpectedly, we also find that amphiphysin-1, like dynamin-1, can transform spherical liposomes into narrow tubules. Moreover, amphiphysin-1 assembles with dynamin-1 into ring-like structures around the tubules and enhances the liposome-fragmenting activity of dynamin-1 in the presence of GTP. These results show that amphiphysin binds lipid bilayers, indicate a potential function for amphiphysin in the changes in bilayer curvature that accompany vesicle budding, and imply a close functional partnership between amphiphysin and dynamin in endocytosis.},

Among them the rvs161 mutant (RVS for Reduced Viability upon Starvation) is sensitive to carbon, nitrogen and sulphur starvation. When these nutrients are depleted in the medium, mutant cells show cellular viability loss with morphological changes. The mutation rvs161-1 is very pleiotropic, and besides the defects in stationary phase entry, the mutant strain presents other alterations: sensitivity to high salt concentrations, hypersensitivity to amino acid analogs, no growth on lactate or acetate medium. The addition of salts or amino acid analogs leads to the same morphological defects observed in starved cells, suggesting that the gene could be implicated mainly in the control of cellular viability. The gene RVS161 was cloned; it codes for a 30,252 daltons protein. No homology was detected with the proteins contained in the databases. Moreover, Southern analysis revealed the presence of other sequences homologous to the RVS161 gene in the yeast genome.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

In addition, cells lacking the actin-binding protein, Sac6p, which is the yeast fimbrin homologue, are defective for internalization of alpha-factor suggesting that actin filament bundling might be required for this step.

In living nerve terminals, the function of the interaction with SH3 domains was examined. Amphiphysin contains an SH3 domain and is a major dynamin binding partner at the synapse. Microinjection of amphiphysin's SH3 domain or of a dynamin peptide containing the SH3 binding site inhibited synaptic vesicle endocytosis at the stage of invaginated clathrin-coated pits, which resulted in an activity-dependent distortion of the synaptic architecture and a depression of transmitter release. These findings demonstrate that SH3-mediated interactions are required for dynamin function and support an essential role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in synaptic vesicle recycling.},

abstract = {The Candida albicans plasma membrane plays critical roles in growth and virulence and as a target for antifungal drugs. Three C. albicans genes that encode Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs homology domain proteins were mutated to define their roles in plasma membrane function. The deletion of RVS161 and RVS167, but not RVS162, caused strong defects. The rvs161$\Delta$ mutant was more defective in endocytosis and morphogenesis than rvs167$\Delta$, but both were strongly defective in polarizing actin patches. Other plasma membrane constituents were still properly localized, including a filipin-stained domain at the hyphal tips. An analysis of growth under different in vitro conditions showed that the rvs161$\Delta$ and rvs167$\Delta$ mutants grew less invasively in agar and also suggested that they have defects in cell wall synthesis and Rim101 pathway signaling. These mutants were also more resistant to the antimicrobial peptide histatin 5 but showed essentially normal responses to the drugs caspofungin and amphotericin. Surprisingly, the rvs161$\Delta$ mutant was more sensitive to fluconazole, whereas the rvs167$\Delta$ mutant was more resistant, indicating that these mutations cause overlapping but distinct effects on cells. The rvs161$\Delta$ and rvs167$\Delta$ mutants both showed greatly reduced virulence in mice. However, the mutants were capable of growing to high levels in kidneys. Histological analyses of infected kidneys revealed that these rvs$\Delta$ mutants grew in a large fungal mass that was walled off by leukocytes, rather than forming disseminated microabscesses as seen for the wild type. The diminished virulence is likely due to a combination of the morphogenesis defects that reduce invasive growth and altered cell wall construction that exposes proinflammatory components to the host immune system.},

abstract = {Sla1 and Rvs167 are yeast proteins required for receptor internalization and organization of the actin cytoskeleton. Here we provide evidence that Sla1 and Rvs167 are orthologues of the mammalian CIN85 and endophilin proteins, respectively, which are required for ligand-stimulated growth factor receptor internalization. Sla1 is similar in domain structure to CIN85 and binds directly to the endophilin-like Rvs167. Akin to CIN85, Sla1 interacts with synaptojanins and a ubiquitin ligase that regulates endocytosis. This ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5, binds directly to both Sla1 and Rvs167. The interaction between Rsp5 and Rvs167 is mediated through Rsp5 WW domains and PXY motifs in the central Gly-Pro-Ala-rich domain of Rvs167. Rvs167 PXY motifs are required for Rsp5-dependent monoubiquitination of Rvs167 on Lys481 in the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. Mutation of Lys481 → Arg causes cells to grow slowly on medium containing 1 m NaCl, although this phenotype is not due to the defect in ubiquitination caused by the K481R mutation. We propose that Rsp5 interaction with Sla1-Rvs167 promotes Rvs167 ubiquitination and regulates activity of this protein complex. Rvs167 ubiquitination is not required for general function of Rvs167, but may control specific Rvs167 SH3 domain-protein interactions or negatively regulate SH3 domain activity.},

The role of the BAR domain proteins in membrane shaping—with a focus on how their structural features are optimized for this function—is explained here., Against the odds of membrane resistance, members of the BIN/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain superfamily shape membranes and their activity is indispensable for a plethora of life functions. While crystal structures of different BAR dimers advanced our understanding of membrane shaping by scaffolding and hydrophobic insertion mechanisms considerably, especially life-imaging techniques and loss-of-function studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis with its gradually increasing curvature show that the initial idea that solely BAR domain curvatures determine their functions is oversimplified. Diagonal placing, lateral lipid-binding modes, additional lipid-binding modules, tilde shapes and formation of macromolecular lattices with different modes of organisation and arrangement increase versatility. A picture emerges, in which BAR domain proteins create macromolecular platforms, that recruit and connect different binding partners and ensure the connection and coordination of the different events during the endocytic process, such as membrane invagination, coat formation, actin nucleation, vesicle size control, fission, detachment and uncoating, in time and space, and may thereby offer mechanistic explanations for how coordination, directionality and effectiveness of a complex process with several steps and key players can be achieved.},

In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics during endocytosis in yeast. Our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels increase and decline in conjunction with coat and actin assembly and disassembly, respectively. Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

abstract = {Summary
The GTPase dynamin, a key player in endocytic membrane fission, interacts with numerous proteins that regulate actin dynamics and generate/sense membrane curvature. To determine the functional relationship between these proteins and dynamin, we have analyzed endocytic intermediates that accumulate in cells that lack dynamin (derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice). In these cells, actin-nucleating proteins, actin, and BAR domain proteins accumulate at the base of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where they support the growth of dynamic long tubular necks. These results, which we show reflect the sequence of events in wild-type cells, demonstrate a concerted action of these proteins prior to, and independent of, dynamin and emphasize similarities between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Our data also demonstrate that the relationship between dynamin and actin is intimately connected to dynamin's endocytic role and that dynamin terminates a powerful actin- and BAR protein-dependent tubulating activity.},

abstract = {Endocytic budding implies the remodeling of a plasma membrane portion from a flat sheet to a closed vesicle. Clathrin- and actin-mediated endocytosis in yeast has proven a very powerful model to study this process, with more than 60 evolutionarily conserved proteins involved in fashioning primary endocytic vesicles. Major progress in the field has been made during the last decades by defining the sequential recruitment of the endocytic machinery at the cell cortex using live-cell fluorescence microscopy. Higher spatial resolution has been recently achieved by developing time-resolved electron microscopy methods, allowing for the first time the visualization of changes in the plasma membrane shape, coupled to the dynamics of the endocytic machinery. Here, we highlight these advances and review recent findings from yeast and mammals that have increased our understanding of where and how endocytic proteins may apply force to remodel the plasma membrane during different stages of the process.},

Calmodulin-binding mutants of Rvs167 exhibited defects in endocytic vesicle release. In vitro, calmodulin enhanced membrane tubulation and constriction by wild-type Rvs167 but not calmodulin-binding-defective mutants.

abstract = {The Hof1 protein (Homologue of Fifteen) regulates formation of the primary septum during cytokinesis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas the orthologous Cdc15 protein in fission yeast regulates the actomyosin ring by using its F-BAR domain to recruit actin nucleators to the cleavage site. Here we show that budding yeast Hof1 also contributes to actin ring assembly in parallel with the Rvs167 protein. Simultaneous deletion of the HOF1 and RVS167 genes is lethal, and cells fail to assemble the actomyosin ring as they progress through mitosis. Although Hof1 and Rvs167 are not orthologues, they both share an analogous structure, with an F-BAR or BAR domain at the amino terminus, capable of inducing membrane curvature, and SH3 domains at the carboxyl terminus that bind to specific proline-rich targets. The SH3 domain of Rvs167 becomes essential for assembly of the actomyosin ring in cells lacking Hof1, suggesting that it helps to recruit a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. This new function of Rvs167 appears to be independent of its known role as a regulator of the Arp2/3 actin nucleator, as actin ring assembly is not abolished by the simultaneous inactivation of Hof1 and Arp2/3. Instead we find that recruitment to the bud-neck of the Iqg1 actin regulator is defective in cells lacking Hof1 and Rvs167, though future studies will be needed to determine if this reflects a direct interaction between these factors. The redundant role of Hof1 in actin ring assembly suggests that the mechanism of actin ring assembly has been conserved to a greater extent across evolution than anticipated previously.},

abstract = {BAR family proteins are a unique class of adaptor proteins characterized by a common N-terminal fold of undetermined function termed the BAR domain. This set of adaptors, which includes the mammalian proteins amphiphysin and Bin1 and the yeast proteins Rvs167p and Rvs161p, has been implicated in diverse cellular processes, including synaptic vesicle endocytosis, actin regulation, differentiation, cell survival, and tumorigenesis. Here we report the identification and characterization of Bin2, a novel protein that contains a BAR domain but that is otherwise structurally dissimilar to other members of the BAR adaptor family. The Bin2 gene is located at chromosome 4q22.1 and is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells. Bin2 is upregulated during differentiation of granulocytes, suggesting that it functions in that lineage. Bin2 formed a stable complex in cells with Bin1, but not with amphiphysin, in a BAR domain-dependent manner. This finding indicates that BAR domains have specific preferences for interaction. However, Bin2 did not influence endocytosis in the same manner as brain-specific splice isoforms of Bin1, nor did it exhibit the tumor suppressor properties inherent to ubiquitous splice isoforms of Bin1. Thus, Bin2 appears to encode a nonredundant function in the BAR adaptor gene family.},

Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) and Fer-CIP4 homology-BAR (F-BAR) proteins can induce membrane curvature and have been suggested to facilitate membrane invagination and scission. Two F-BAR proteins, Syp1 and Bzz1, are found at budding yeast endocytic sites. Syp1 arrives early but departs from the endocytic site before formation of deep membrane invaginations and scission. Using genetic, spatiotemporal, and ultrastructural analyses, we demonstrate that Bzz1, the heterodimeric BAR domain protein Rvs161/167, actin polymerization, and the lipid phosphatase Sjl2 cooperate, each through a distinct mechanism, to induce membrane scission in yeast. Additionally, actin assembly and Rvs161/167 cooperate to drive formation of deep invaginations. Finally, we find that Bzz1, acting at the invagination base, stabilizes endocytic sites and functions with Rvs161/167, localized along the tubule, to achieve proper endocytic membrane geometry necessary for efficient scission. Together, our results reveal that dynamic interplay between a lipid phosphatase, actin assembly, and membrane-sculpting proteins leads to proper membrane shaping, tubule stabilization, and scission.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the actin cytoskeleton is depolarized by NaCl stress. In this study, the response was maximal after 30 min, and then actin patches repolarized. Rvs161p was required for actin repolarization because the rvs161delta mutant did not repolarize actin patches after growth in a salt medium. Mutations suppressing the rvs161delta-related salt sensitivity all occurred in genes required for sphingolipid biosynthesis: FEN1, SUR4, SUR2, SUR1, and IPT1. These suppressors also suppressed act1-1-related salt sensitivity and the defect in actin repolarization of the rvs161delta mutant, providing a link between sphingolipids and actin polarization. Indeed, deletion of the suppressor genes suppressed the rvs161delta defect in actin repolarization in two ways: either actin was not depolarized at the wild-type level in a set of suppressor mutants, or actin was repolarized in the absence of Rvs161p in the other suppressor mutants. Rvs161p was localized as cortical patches that concentrated at polarization sites, i.e., bud emergence and septa, and was found to be associated with lipid rafts. An important link between sphingolipids and actin polarization is that Rvs161p was required for actin repolarization and was found to be located in lipid rafts.},

abstract = {During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, branched actin polymerization nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex provides force needed to drive vesicle internalization. Las17 (yeast WASp) is the strongest activator of the Arp2/3 complex in yeast cells; it is not autoinhibited and arrives to endocytic sites 20 s before actin polymerization begins. It is unclear how Las17 is kept inactive for 20 s at endocytic sites, thus restricting actin polymerization to late stages of endocytosis. In this paper, we demonstrate that Las17 is part of a large and biochemically stable complex with Sla1, a clathrin adaptor that inhibits Las17 activity. The interaction is direct, multivalent, and strong, and was mapped to novel Las17 polyproline motifs that are simultaneously class I and class II. In vitro pyrene-actin polymerization assays established that Sla1 inhibition of Las17 activity depends on the class I/II Las17 polyproline motifs and is based on competition between Sla1 and monomeric actin for binding to Las17. Furthermore, live-cell imaging showed the interaction with Sla1 is important for normal Las17 recruitment to endocytic sites, inhibition during the initial 20 s, and efficient endocytosis. These results advance our understanding of the regulation of actin polymerization in endocytosis.},

The actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex, and there is growing evidence that F-actin plays a direct role in these endocytic events. Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process. Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide powerful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites. In this review, we focus on progress made in elucidating the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis.},

Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is an essential process that forms vesicles from the plasma membrane. Although most of the protein components of the endocytic protein machinery have been thoroughly characterized, their organization at the endocytic site is poorly understood. We developed a fluorescence microscopy method to track the average positions of yeast endocytic proteins in relation to each other with a time precision below 1 s and with a spatial precision of {\~{}}10 nm. With these data, integrated with shapes of endocytic membrane intermediates and with superresolution imaging, we could visualize the dynamic architecture of the endocytic machinery. We showed how different coat proteins are distributed within the coat structure and how the assembly dynamics of N-BAR proteins relate to membrane shape changes. Moreover, we found that the region of actin polymerization is located at the base of the endocytic invagination, with the growing ends of filaments pointing toward the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking the amphiphysin-like orthologs, Rvs161 or Rvs167, are unable to thrive under many stress conditions. Here we show cells lacking Rvs161 require Cdc55, the B subunit of the yeast ceramide-activated protein phosphatase, for viability under heat stress. By using specific rvs mutant alleles, we linked this lethal genetic interaction to loss of Rvs161 endocytic domain function. Recessive mutations in the sphingolipid pathway, such as deletion of the very long-chain fatty acid elongase, Sur4, suppress the osmotic growth defect of rvs161 cells. We demonstrate that Cdc55 is required for sur4-dependent suppressor activity and that protein phosphatase activation, through overexpression of CDC55 alone, can also remediate this defect. Loss of SUR4 in rvs161 cells reinitiates Ste3 a-factor receptor endocytosis and requires Cdc55 function to do so. Moreover, overexpression of CDC55 reinitiates Ste3 endocytic-dependent degradation and restores fluid phase endocytosis in rvs161 cells. In contrast, loss of SUR4 or CDC55 overexpression does not remediate the actin polarization defects of osmotic stressed rvs161 cells. Importantly, remediation of rvs161 defects by protein phosphatase activation requires the ceramide-activated protein phosphatase catalytic subunit, Sit4, and the protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunits, Pph21/Pph22. Finally, genetic analyses reveal a synthetic lethal interaction between loss of CDC55 and gene deletions lethal with rvs161, all of which function in endocytosis.},

abstract = {Lipids and several specialized proteins are thought to be able to sense the curvature of membranes (MC). Here we used quantitative fluorescence microscopy to measure curvature-selective binding of amphipathic motifs on single liposomes 50–700 nm in diameter. Our results revealed that sensing is predominantly mediated by a higher density of binding sites on curved membranes instead of higher affinity. We proposed a model based on curvature-induced defects in lipid packing that related these findings to lipid sorting and accurately predicted the existence of a new ubiquitous class of curvature sensors: membrane-anchored proteins. The fact that unrelated structural motifs such as $\alpha$-helices and alkyl chains sense MC led us to propose that MC sensing is a generic property of curved membranes rather than a property of the anchoring molecules. We therefore anticipate that MC will promote the redistribution of proteins that are anchored in membranes through other types of hydrophobic moieties.},

@article{Boettner2009,
abstract = {Background
Actin polymerization by Arp2/3 complex must be tightly regulated to promote endocytosis. While many Arp2/3 complex activators have been identified, mechanisms for its negative regulation have remained more elusive. We analyzed the yeast arp2-7 allele, which is biochemically unique in causing unregulated actin assembly in vitro in the absence of Arp2/3 activators.

Results
We examined endocytosis in arp2-7 mutants by live cell imaging of Sla1-GFP, a coat marker, and Abp1-RFP, which marks the later actin phase of endocytosis. Sla1-GFP and Abp1-RFP lifetimes were accelerated in arp2-7 mutants, which is opposite to actin nucleation-impaired arp2 alleles or deletions of Arp2/3 activators. We performed a screen for multi-copy suppressors of arp2-7 and identified SYP1, a FCHO1 homologue, which contains F-BAR and AP-2$\mu$ homology domains. Over-expression of SYP1 in arp2-7 cells slowed Sla1-GFP lifetimes closer to wild type cells. Further, purified Syp1 directly inhibited Las17/WASp stimulation of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly. This activity was mapped to a fragment of Syp1 located between its F-BAR and AP-2$\mu$ homology domains, and depends on non-VCA sequences in Las17/WASp.

Conclusions
Together, these data identify Syp1 as a novel negative regulator of WASp-Arp2/3 complex that helps choreograph the precise timing of actin assembly during endocytosis.},

abstract = {FUS7 was previously identified by a mutation that causes a defect in cell fusion in a screen for bilateral mating defects. Here we show that FUS7 is allelic to RVS161/END6, a gene implicated in a variety of  processes including viability after starvation, endocytosis, and actin cytoskeletal organization. Two lines of evidence indicate that RVS161/END6's endocytic function is not required for cell fusion. First, several other  endocytic mutants showed no cell fusion defects. Second, we isolated five function-specific alleles of  RVS161/FUS7 that were defective for endocytosis, but  not mating, and three alleles that were defective for cell  fusion but not endocytosis. The organization of the actin cytoskeleton was normal in the cell fusion mutants,  indicating that Rvs161p's function in cell fusion is independent of actin organization. The three to fourfold induction of RVS161 by mating pheromone and the localization of Rvs161p-GFP to the cell fusion zone  suggested that Rvs161p plays a direct role in cell fusion.  The phenotypes of double mutants, the coprecipitation  of Rvs161p and Fus2p, and the fact that the stability of  Fus2p was strongly dependent on Rvs161p's mating  function lead to the conclusion that Rvs161p is required  to interact with Fus2p for efficient cell fusion.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

abstract = {Using a structure–function analysis, we find that Rvs proteins are initially recruited to sites of endocytosis through their curvature-sensing and membrane-binding ability in a manner dependent on complex sphingolipids., BAR domains are protein modules that bind to membranes and promote membrane curvature. One type of BAR domain, the N-BAR domain, contains an additional N-terminal amphipathic helix, which contributes to membrane-binding and bending activities. The only known N-BAR-domain proteins in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rvs161 and Rvs167, are required for endocytosis. We have explored the mechanism of N-BAR-domain function in the endocytosis process using a combined biochemical and genetic approach. We show that the purified Rvs161–Rvs167 complex binds to liposomes in a curvature-independent manner and promotes tubule formation in vitro. Consistent with the known role of BAR domain polymerization in membrane bending, we found that Rvs167 BAR domains interact with each other at cortical actin patches in vivo. To characterize N-BAR-domain function in endocytosis, we constructed yeast strains harboring changes in conserved residues in the Rvs161 and Rvs167 N-BAR domains. In vivo analysis of the rvs endocytosis mutants suggests that Rvs proteins are initially recruited to sites of endocytosis through their membrane-binding ability. We show that inappropriate regulation of complex sphingolipid and phosphoinositide levels in the membrane can impinge on Rvs function, highlighting the relationship between membrane components and N-BAR-domain proteins in vivo.},

We show that Gyl1p and Gyp5p interact directly with each other, likely through their carboxy-terminal coiled-coil regions.

Genetic experiments suggest a role for Gyp5p and Gyl1p in ER to Golgi trafficking, consistent with their biochemical role.

abstract = {The BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain is the most conserved feature in amphiphysins from yeast to human and is also found in endophilins and nadrins. We solved the structure of the Drosophila amphiphysin BAR domain. It is a crescent-shaped dimer that binds preferentially to highly curved negatively charged membranes. With its N-terminal amphipathic helix and BAR domain (N-BAR), amphiphysin can drive membrane curvature in vitro and in vivo. The structure is similar to that of arfaptin2, which we find also binds and tubulates membranes. From this, we predict that BAR domains are in many protein families, including sorting nexins, centaurins, and oligophrenins. The universal and minimal BAR domain is a dimerization, membrane-binding, and curvature-sensing module.},

abstract = {We have used a lipophilic styryl dye, N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4- (p-diethylaminophenyl-hexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromide (FM 4-64), as a vital stain to follow bulk membrane-internalization and transport to the vacuole in yeast. After treatment for 60 min at 30 degrees C, FM 4-64 stained the vacuole membrane (ring staining pattern). FM 4-64 did not appear to reach the vacuole by passive diffusion because at 0 degree C it exclusively stained the plasma membrane (PM). The PM staining decreased after warming cells to 25 degrees C and small punctate structures became apparent in the cytoplasm within 5-10 min. After an additional 20-40 min, the PM and cytoplasmic punctate staining disappeared concomitant with staining of the vacuolar membrane. Under steady state conditions, FM 4-64 staining was specific for vacuolar membranes; other membrane structures were not stained. The dye served as a sensitive reporter of vacuolar dynamics, detecting such events as segregation structure formation during mitosis, vacuole fission/fusion events, and vacuolar morphology in different classes of vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants. A particularly striking pattern was observed in class E mutants (e.g., vps27) where 500-700 nm organelles (presumptive prevacuolar compartments) were intensely stained with FM 4-64 while the vacuole membrane was weakly fluorescent. Internalization of FM 4-64 at 15 degrees C delayed vacuolar labeling and trapped FM 4-64 in cytoplasmic intermediates between the PM and the vacuole. The intermediate structures in the cytoplasm are likely to be endosomes as their staining was temperature, time, and energy dependent. Interestingly, unlike Lucifer yellow uptake, vacuolar labeling by FM 4-64 was not blocked in sec18, sec14, end3, and end4 mutants, but was blocked in sec1 mutant cells. Finally, using permeabilized yeast spheroplasts to reconstitute FM 4-64 transport, we found that delivery of FM 4-64 from the endosome-like intermediate compartment (labeled at 15 degrees C) to the vacuole was ATP and cytosol dependent. Thus, we show that FM 4-64 is a new vital stain for the vacuolar membrane, a marker for endocytic intermediates, and a fluor for detecting endosome to vacuole membrane transport in vitro.},

abstract = {The lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns[4,5]P2) appears to play an important role in endocytosis. However, the timing of its formation and turnover, and its specific functions at different stages during endocytic internalization, have not been established. In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics during endocytosis in yeast. Our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels increase and decline in conjunction with coat and actin assembly and disassembly, respectively. Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

abstract = {BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domains and amphipathic $\alpha$-helices (AHs) are believed to be sensors of membrane curvature thus facilitating the assembly of protein complexes on curved membranes. Here, we used quantitative fluorescence microscopy to compare the binding of both motifs on single nanosized liposomes of different diameters and therefore membrane curvature. Characterization of members of the three BAR domain families showed surprisingly that the crescent-shaped BAR dimer with its positively charged concave face is not able to sense membrane curvature. Mutagenesis on BAR domains showed that membrane curvature sensing critically depends on the N-terminal AH and furthermore that BAR domains sense membrane curvature through hydrophobic insertion in lipid packing defects and not through electrostatics. Consequently, amphipathic motifs, such as AHs, that are often associated with BAR domains emerge as an important means for a protein to sense membrane curvature. Measurements on single liposomes allowed us to document heterogeneous binding behaviour within the ensemble and quantify the influence of liposome polydispersity on bulk membrane curvature sensing experiments. The latter results suggest that bulk liposome-binding experiments should be interpreted with great caution.},

@article{Rodal2003a,
abstract = {Background: WASp family proteins promote actin filament assembly by activating Arp2/3 complex and are regulated spatially and temporally to assemble specialized actin structures used in diverse cellular processes. Some WASp family members are autoinhibited until bound by activating ligands; however, regulation of the budding yeast WASp homolog (Las17/Bee1) has not yet been explored.
Results: We isolated full-length Las17 and characterized its biochemical activities on yeast Arp2/3 complex. Purified Las17 was not autoinhibited; in this respect, it is more similar to SCAR/WAVE than to WASp proteins. Las17 was a much stronger activator of Arp2/3 complex than its carboxyl-terminal (WA) fragment. In addition, actin polymerization stimulated by Las17-Arp2/3 was much less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of profilin compared to polymerization stimulated by WA-Arp2/3. Two SH3 domain-containing binding partners of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, were purified and were shown to cooperate in inhibiting Las17 activity. The two SLA1 SH3 domains required for this inhibitory activity in vitro were also required in vivo, in combination with BBC1, for cell viability and normal actin organization.
Conclusions: Full-length Las17 is not autoinhibited and activates Arp2/3 complex more strongly than its WA domain alone, revealing an important role for the Las17 amino terminus in Arp2/3 complex activation. Two of the SH3 domain-containing ligands of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, cooperate to inhibit Las17 activity in vitro and are required for a shared function in actin organization in vivo. Our results show that, like SCAR/WAVE, WASp proteins can be controlled by negative regulation through the combined actions of multiple ligands.},

To execute vital functions such as locomotion or receptor turnover, cells need to control the shapes of their membranes. In part, this control is achieved through membrane-bending proteins, such as the Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain proteins. Many open questions remain about the mechanisms by which membrane-bending proteins function. Addressing this shortfall, recent structures of BAR protein:membrane complexes support existing mechanistic models, but also produced novel insights into how BAR domain proteins sense, stabilize, and generate curvature. Here we review these recent findings, focusing on how BAR proteins interact with the membrane, and how the resulting scaffold structures might aid the recruitment of other proteins to the sites where membranes are bent.},

abstract = {Yeast Las17 protein is homologous to the Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome protein, which is implicated in severe immunodeficiency. Las17p/Bee1p has been shown to be important for actin patch assembly and actin polymerization. Here we show that Las17p interacts with the Arp2/3 complex. LAS17 is an allele-specific multicopy suppressor of ARP2 and ARP3 mutations; overexpression restores both actin patch organization and endocytosis defects in ARP2 temperature-sensitive (ts) cells. Six of seven ARP2 ts mutants and at least one ARP3 ts mutant are synthetically lethal with las17$\Delta$ ts confirming functional interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. Further characterization of las17$\Delta$ cells showed that receptor-mediated internalization of $\alpha$ factor by the Ste2 receptor is severely defective. The polarity of normal bipolar bud site selection is lost. Las17-gfp remains localized in cortical patches in vivo independently of polymerized actin and is required for the polarized localization of Arp2/3 as well as actin. Coimmunoprecipitation of Arp2p with Las17p indicates that Las17p interacts directly with the complex. Two hybrid results also suggest that Las17p interacts with actin, verprolin, Rvs167p and several other proteins including Src homology 3 (SH3) domain proteins, suggesting that Las17p may integrate signals from different regulatory cascades destined for the Arp2/3p complex and the actin cytoskeleton.},

When these nutrients are depleted in the medium, mutant cells show cellular viability loss with morphological changes. The mutation rvs161-1 is very pleiotropic, and besides the defects in stationary phase entry, the mutant strain presents other alterations: sensitivity to high salt concentrations, hypersensitivity to amino acid analogs, no growth on lactate or acetate medium. The addition of salts or amino acid analogs leads to the same morphological defects observed in starved cells, suggesting that the gene could be implicated mainly in the control of cellular viability. The gene RVS161 was cloned; it codes for a 30,252 daltons protein. No homology was detected with the proteins contained in the databases.

abstract = {Rvs167 and Rvs161 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are amphiphysin family proteins, which are involved in several important cellular events, such as invagination and scission of endocytic vesicles, and actin cytoskeleton organization. It has been reported that cellular dysfunctions caused by deletion of RVS167 or RVS161 are rescued by deletion of specific nonessential sphingolipid-metabolizing enzyme genes. Here, we found that yeast cells lacking RVS167 or RVS161 exhibit a decrease in sphingolipid levels. In rvs167∆ cells, the expression level of Orm2, a negative regulator of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzing the initial step of sphingolipid biosynthesis, was increased in a calcineurin-dependent manner, and the decrease in sphingolipid levels in rvs167∆ cells was reversed on deletion of ORM2. Moreover, repression of both ORM1 and ORM2 expression or overexpression of SPT caused a strong growth defect of rvs167∆ cells, indicating that enhancement of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis is detrimental to rvs167∆ cells. In contrast, partial repression of LCB1-encoding SPT suppressed abnormal phenotypes caused by the deletion of RVS167, including supersensitivity to high temperature and salt stress, and impairment of endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton organization. In addition, the partial repression of SPT activity suppressed the temperature supersensitivity and abnormal vacuolar morphology caused by deletion of VPS1 encoding a dynamin-like GTPase, which is required for vesicle scission and is functionally closely related to Rvs167/Rvs161, whereas repression of both ORM1 and ORM2 expression in vps1∆ cells caused a growth defect. Thus, it was suggested that proper regulation of SPT activity is indispensable for amphiphysin-deficient cells.},

Moreover, if a tagged Rvs 167p protein was immuno adsorbed under non-denaturing conditions, it brought along the Rvs161p protein. These results confirmed the hypothesis of an in vivo complex between the two proteins.},

@article{Soulard2002a,
abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

abstract = {Fluorescence live-cell imaging has temporally resolved the conserved choreography of more than 30 proteins involved in clathrin and actin-mediated endocytic budding from the plasma membrane. However, the resolution of these studies is insufficient to unveil how the endocytic machinery actually drives membrane deformation in vivo. In this study, we use quantitative immuno-EM to introduce the temporal dimension to the ultrastructural analysis of membrane budding and define changes in the topography of the lipid bilayer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Using this approach, we frame the emergence of membrane curvature with respect to the recruitment of endocytic factors and show that constriction of the invaginations correlates with translocation of membrane-sculpting proteins. Furthermore, we show that initial bending of the plasma membrane is independent of actin and clathrin polymerization and precedes building of an actin cap branched by the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, our data indicate that constriction and additional elongation of the endocytic profiles require the mechanochemical activity of the myosins-I. Altogether, this work provides major insights into the molecular mechanisms driving membrane deformation in a cellular context.},

@article{Kukulski2012,
abstract = {Summary
Endocytosis, like many dynamic cellular processes, requires precise temporal and spatial orchestration of complex protein machinery to mediate membrane budding. To understand how this machinery works, we directly correlated fluorescence microscopy of key protein pairs with electron tomography. We systematically located 211 endocytic intermediates, assigned each to a specific time window in endocytosis, and reconstructed their ultrastructure in 3D. The resulting virtual ultrastructural movie defines the protein-mediated membrane shape changes during endocytosis in budding yeast. It reveals that clathrin is recruited to flat membranes and does not initiate curvature. Instead, membrane invagination begins upon actin network assembly followed by amphiphysin binding to parallel membrane segments, which promotes elongation of the invagination into a tubule. Scission occurs on average 9 s after initial bending when invaginations are ∼100 nm deep, releasing nonspherical vesicles with 6,400 nm2 mean surface area. Direct correlation of protein dynamics with ultrastructure provides a quantitative 4D resource.},

@article{Floyd2001,
abstract = {Amphiphysin 1 is a phosphoprotein expressed at high levels in neurons, where it participates in synaptic vesicle endocytosis and neurite outgrowth. It is a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 5, a member of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase family, which has been functionally linked to neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth via its action on the actin cytoskeleton. The yeast homologue of amphiphysin, Rvs167, functions in endocytosis and actin dynamics, is phosphorylated by the cdk5 homologue Pho85, and binds the Pho85 regulatory subunit Pcl2. We show here that amphiphysin 1 interacts with the cdk5-activating subunit p35 and that this interaction is mediated by the conserved NH2-terminal region of amphiphysin. Amphiphysin 1 colocalizes with p35 in the growth cones of neurons and at actin-rich peripheral lamellipodia in transfected fibroblasts. Amphiphysin is phosphorylated by cdk5 in a region including serines 272, 276, and 285. Amphiphysin 1 is also phosphorylated by the cdc2/cyclin B kinase complex in the same region and undergoes mitotic phosphorylation in dividing cells. These data indicate that phosphorylation by members of the cyclin-dependent kinase family is a conserved property of amphiphysin and suggest that this phosphorylation may play an important physiological role both in mitosis and in differentiated cells.},

abstract = {Vesicle formation is accompanied by dramatic changes in membrane geometry. The role of the BAR domain proteins in membrane shaping—with a focus on how their structural features are optimized for this function—is explained here., Against the odds of membrane resistance, members of the BIN/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain superfamily shape membranes and their activity is indispensable for a plethora of life functions. While crystal structures of different BAR dimers advanced our understanding of membrane shaping by scaffolding and hydrophobic insertion mechanisms considerably, especially life-imaging techniques and loss-of-function studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis with its gradually increasing curvature show that the initial idea that solely BAR domain curvatures determine their functions is oversimplified. Diagonal placing, lateral lipid-binding modes, additional lipid-binding modules, tilde shapes and formation of macromolecular lattices with different modes of organisation and arrangement increase versatility. A picture emerges, in which BAR domain proteins create macromolecular platforms, that recruit and connect different binding partners and ensure the connection and coordination of the different events during the endocytic process, such as membrane invagination, coat formation, actin nucleation, vesicle size control, fission, detachment and uncoating, in time and space, and may thereby offer mechanistic explanations for how coordination, directionality and effectiveness of a complex process with several steps and key players can be achieved.},

abstract = {Endocytosis is a well-conserved process by which cells invaginate small portions of the plasma membrane to create vesicles containing extracellular and transmembrane cargo proteins. Dozens of proteins and hundreds of specific binding interactions are needed to coordinate and regulate these events. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model system to study clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Pan1 is thought to be a scaffolding protein due to its interactions with numerous proteins that act throughout the endocytic process. Previous research has characterized many Pan1 binding interactions, but due to Pan1's essential nature, the exact mechanisms of Pan1's function in endocytosis have been difficult to define. We created a novel Pan1-degron allele, Pan1-AID, in which Pan1 can be specifically and efficiently degraded in less than one hour upon addition of the plant hormone auxin. The loss of Pan1 caused a delay in endocytic progression and weakened connections between the coat/actin machinery and the membrane, leading to an arrest in CME. Additionally, we determined a critical role for the central region of Pan1 in endocytosis and viability. The regions important for endocytosis and viability can be separated suggesting that Pan1 may have a distinct role in the cell that is essential for viability.},

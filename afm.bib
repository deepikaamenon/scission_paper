abstract = {Plant cell growth depends on a delicate balance between an inner drive—the hydrostatic pressure known as turgor—and an outer restraint—the polymeric wall that surrounds a cell. The classical technique to measure turgor in a single cell, the pressure probe, is intrusive and cannot be applied to small cells. In order to overcome these limitations, we developed a method that combines quantification of topography, nanoindentation force measurements, and an interpretation using a published mechanical model for the pointlike loading of thin elastic shells. We used atomic force microscopy to estimate the elastic properties of the cell wall and turgor pressure from a single force-depth curve. We applied this method to onion epidermal peels and quantified the response to changes in osmolality of the bathing solution. Overall our approach is accessible and enables a straightforward estimation of the hydrostatic pressure inside a walled cell.},

@article{Minc2009,
abstract = {Mechanical properties of fungal cells participate in the control of cell size, morphogenesis and function [-]. Tip growth can be understood by a viscoelastic model in which growth is derived by high internal turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity. To understand how these properties regulate growth in the rod-shaped fission yeast Schizosaccaromyces pombe, we measure key parameters by using femtoliter cylindrical PDMS microchambers with varying elasticity as force sensors for single cells. By buckling cells in these chambers, we determine the elastic surface modulus of the cell wall to be 20.2 ± 6.1 N.m-1. By analyzing the growth as they push against the walls of the chamber, we derive force-velocity relationships and values for internal effective turgor pressure of 0.85 ± 0.15 MPa and a growth stalling force of 11 ± 3 $\mu$N. The behavior of cells buckling under the force of their own growth provides an independent test of this model and parameters. Force generation is dependent on turgor pressure and a glycerol synthesis gene gpd1+ (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and is independent of actin cables. This study develops a quantitative framework for tip cell growth and characterize mechanisms of force generation that could contribute, for instance, in fungal invasion into host tissues.},

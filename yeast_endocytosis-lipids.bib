abstract = {We recently demonstrated that the S. cerevisiae INP51 locus (YIL002c) encodes an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase. Here we describe two related yeast loci, INP52 (YNL106c) and INP53 (YOR109w). Like Inp51p, the primary structures of Inp52p and Inp53p resemble the mammalian synaptic vesicle-associated protein, synaptojanin, and contain a carboxy-terminal catalytic domain and an amino-terminal SAC1-like segment. Inp51p (108 kD), Inp52p (136 kD) and Inp53p (124 kD) are membrane-associated. Single null mutants (inp51, inp52, or inp53) are viable. Both inp51 inp52 and inp52 inp53 double mutants display compromised cell growth, whereas an inp51 inp53 double mutant does not. An inp51 inp52 inp53 triple mutant is inviable on standard medium, but can grow weakly on media supplemented with an osmotic stabilizer (1 M sorbitol). An inp51 mutation, and to a lesser degree an inp52 mutation, confers cold-resistant growth in a strain background that cannot grow at temperatures below 15 degrees. Analysis of inositol metabolites in vivo showed measurable accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the inp51 mutant. Electron microscopy revealed plasma membrane invaginations and cell wall thickening in double mutants and the triple mutant grown in sorbitol-containing medium. A fluorescent dye that detects endocytic and vacuolar membranes suggests that the vacuole is highly fragmented in inp51 inp52 double mutants. Our observations indicate that Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p have distinct functions and that substrates and/or products of inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases may have roles in vesicle trafficking, membrane structure, and/or cell wall formation.},

@article{McPherson1996a,
abstract = {Synaptojanin is a nerve terminal protein of relative molecular mass 145,000 which appears to participate with dynamin in synaptic vesicle recycling. The central region of synaptojanin defines it as a member of the inositol-5-phosphatase family, which includes the product of the gene that is defective in the oculocerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe. Synaptojanin has 5-phosphatase activity and its amino-terminal domain is homologous with the yeast protein Sac1 (Rsd1), which is genetically implicated in phospholipid metabolism and in the function of the actin cytoskeleton. The carboxy terminus, which is of different lengths in adult and developing neurons owing to the alternative use of two termination sites, is proline-rich, consistent with the reported interaction of synaptojanin with the SH3 domains of Grb2 (refs 1, 2). Synaptojanin is the only other major brain protein besides dynamin that binds the SH3 domain of amphiphysin, a presynaptic protein with a putative function in endocytosis. Our results suggest a link between phosphoinositide metabolism and synaptic vesicle recycling.},

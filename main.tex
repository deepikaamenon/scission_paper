\section{Introduction}

In Clathrin-mediated endocytosis, a flat plasma membrane is pulled into a tubular invagination that eventually forms a vesicle. Forces that drive the transition from invagination to spherical vesicle in mammalian cells are provided by constriction of the GTPase Dynamin. Dynamin is now known to act in concert with the crescent-shaped N-BAR proteins Endophilin and Amphyphysin (ref. Dynamin papers). Proline-rich motifs on the Dynamin. In yeast cells, what causes membrane scission is unclear, although the yeast N-BAR protein complex Rvs has been identified as an important component of the scission module.  In yeast, the Amphiphysin and Endophilin homologue Rvs is a heterodimeric complex composed of Rvs161 and Rvs167 (Friesen et al., 2006). Deletion of Rvs reduces scission efficiency by nearly 30\% and reduces the invagination lengths at which scission occurs (ref Marko, wanda). Apart from a canonical N-BAR domain which forms a cresent-shaped structure,  Rvs167 has a Glycine-Proline-Alanine rich (GPA) region and a C-terminal SH3 domain. Rvs161 and Rvs167 N-BAR domains are 42\% similar, and 21\% identical, but are not interchangeable (Sivadon, Crouzet and Aigle, 1997). The GPA region is thought to act as a linker with no known other function, while loss of the SH3 domain affects budding pattern and actin morphology. Most Rvs deletion phenotypes can however, be rescued by expression of the BAR domain alone (Sivadon, Crouzet and Aigle, 1997), suggesting that the BAR domains are the main functional unit of the Rvs complex. Homology modelling has shown that the BAR domain of Rvs167 is similar to Amphiphysin and Endophilin (Youn et al., 2010), and is therefore likely to function similarly to the mammalian homologues. In keeping with this theory, Rvs has been shown to tubulate liposomes in vitro (Youn et al., 2010). The Rvs complex arrives at endocytic sites in the last stage of the endocytosis, and disassembles rapidly at the time of membrane scission (Picco et al., 2015), consistent with a role in membrane scission. While it is known to be involved in the last stages of endocytosis, a mechanistic understanding of the influence of Rvs on scission however, remains incomplete. u89

We used quantitative live-cell imaging and genetic manipulation in S.cereviciae to investigate the influence of Rvs and several Rvs interacting proteins that have been suggested to have a role in scission. We found that arrival of Rvs to endocytic sites is timed by interaction of its BAR domain with a specific membrane curvature. The Rvs167 SH3 domain affects localization efficiency of the Rvs complex and also influences invagination dynamics. This indicates that both BAR and SH3 domains are important for the role of Rvs as a regulator of scission. We tested current models of membrane scission, and find that deleting yeast synaptojanins or dynamin does not change scission dynamics. Interfacial forces at lipid boundaries are therefore unlikely to be sufficient for scission, and forces exerted by dynamin are not required. Furthermore, invagination length is insensitive to overexpression of Rvs, suggesting that the recently proposed mechanism of BAR-induced protein friction on the membrane is not likely to drive scission. We propose that recruitment of Rvs BAR domains prevents scission and allows invaginations to grow by stabilizing them. We also propose that vesicle formation is dependent on forces exerted by a different module of the endocytic pathway, the actin network. Preventing premature membrane scission via BAR interaction could allow invaginations to grow to a particular length and accumulate enough forces within the actin network to reliably cut the membrane. 


\section{Results}
\subsection{Vps1 does not influence coat or scission dynamics}

Endocytic membrane scission in mammalian cells is understood to be driven by constriction of the tubule neck by the Gtpase Dynamin (Grigliatti et al., 1973; Poodry and Edgar, 1979; van der Bliek and Meyerowrtz, 1991). In yeast, the Dynamin-like protein Vps1 is reportedly recruited to endocytic sites (refAyscough). To test whether Vps1 influences scission, endocytic dynamics are observed in cells lacking Vps1 and compared against WT cells. Fig1a shows cells and kymographs of endocytic coat protein Sla1 endogenously tagged at the N-terminus with eGFP in WT and \textit{vps1$\Delta$} cells. In Fig.1b, the averaged centroid trajectory (ref2andrea)- henceforth centroid- of Sla1-eGFP is tracked in ~50 endocytic sites in \textit{vps1$\Delta$} and wild-type cells. Inward movement of Sla1 centroid serves as a proxy for plasma membrane movement through the endocytic process (ref2andrea). Simultaneous tracking of GFP-tagged protein of interest and m-Cherry tagged Actin binding Protein Abp1 allows us to align all other proteins to the Abp1 reference centroid (ref2andrea). Time=0 is established as the peak of the Abp1 fluorescence intensity, which in wild-type cells is concomitant with the peak of Rvs167 fluorescent intensity (ref2andrea, ref3wanda), and is time window in which scission occurs {ref2andrea}. 

Centroid movement of Sla1-eGFP in wild-type cells shows a linear movement to about 150nm. Sla1 movement in \textit{vps1$\Delta$} cells has the same depth of inward movement to about 150nm, and has the same rate as in wild-type cells. This indicates that plasma membrane dynamics remain the same in the absence of recruitment of Vps1. 

Centroid tracking has shown that the number of molecules of Rvs167 peaks at the time of scission, and is followed by a rapid loss of fluorescent intensity, simultaneous with a sharp jump of the centroid into the cytoplasm. This jump, also seen in Rvs167-GFP kymographs, is interpreted as loss of protein on the invagination on the membrane tube, causing an apparent spatial jump to the protein localized at the base of the newly formed vesicle. Kymographs of Rvs167-GFP in Vps1 deleted cells, show the same jump, indicating that vesicles are formed in the same position in Vps1 deletion cells as in WT cells. Hence, although Vps1 deletion leads to a growth defect at 37C (as has been shown before, supplementary Fig.1), lack of Vps1 protein does not influence the endocytic process.

\subsection{Synaptojanins likely influence vesicle uncoating, but not scission dynamics.}

As an alternate to forces from Dynamin constriction, Liu et al (refliu) have proposed that an interaction between PiP2-hyrdolyzing Synaptojanins and BAR proteins could drive membrane scission. Here Rvs BAR domains would form a scaffold on the membrane tube, preventing hydrolysis of underlying PIP2. Synaptojanin would arrive at inavaginated membranes, and hydrolyse unprotected PIP2. This generates a lipid boundary between BAR-protected PIP2 at the tube and hydrolyzed PIP2 at the bud tip. A line tension thus formed at the interphase between the two lipid types would then generate enough force to pinch off a vesicle.

Of the three Synaptojanin-like proteins in yeast- Inp51, Inp52 and Inp53- Inp51 exhibits a diffuse cytoplasmic signal. Inp53 localizes to patches within the cytoplasm- cellular localization is consistent with involvement in trans-Golgi signalling (refGolgi). Inp53 was not investigated further. Inp52 localizes to cortical actin patches that are endocytic sites. Two channel alignment shows that Inp52 patches arrive in the late scission stage, and localizes to the bud tip, consistent with a role in membrane scission. 

Role of Inp51 and Inp52 are tested by following Sla1-GFP and Rvs167-GFP in cells with either Inp51, Inp52, or both deleted. Retraction events do not significantly increase compared to the WT in either inp51del or inp52del cells. Magnitude and speed of coat movement in inp51del is the same as the WT. In inp52del cells, coat movement also has the same magnitude and speed, but GFP signal is persistant after membrane scission. This delay in decrease of Sla1-GFP signal is consistent with delay in vesicle uncoating rather than membrane scissison. Similarly, Rvs167 disassembly has a delay, while the assembly is similar to WT, indicating a delay in removing endocytic proteins from the newly formed vesicle. Assembly of Rvs167 has a delay in inp51deleted cells, which could indicate a defect in recruiting proteins to endocytic sites, or in progression of endocytic invaginations. Since Sla1 movement is the same, we suggest a defect in the former rather than latter.

\subsection{Rvs deletion reduces coat movement}
The Rvs complex itself is known to influence scission: deletion reduces scission efficiency by 30\% (ref1marko). Failed scission events are characterized by inward movement, followed by retraction of the coat protein Sla1 (ref1marko). Contribution of Rvs to the scission process however, is currently unclear. In the remaining 70\% of successful invaginations, inward movement of the coat protein Sla1 also deviates from the wild-type. In Fig.1, the averaged centroid trajectory (ref2andrea) of Sla1-eGFP is tracked in rvs167deletion and wild-type cells. Time alignment is established by tracking the centroid of a second protein, here m-Cherry tagged Actin binding protein Abp1. Simultaneous tracking of GFP-tagged protein of interest and m-Cherry tagged Abp1 allows us to align all other proteins to the Abp1 reference centroid (ref2andrea). Time=0, is established as the peak of the Abp1 fluorescence intensity, which in wild-type is concomitant with the peak of Rvs167 fluorescent intensity (ref2andrea, ref3wanda), and is time in which scission occurs. Sla1 centroid in rvs167deletion cells follows the wild-type centroid movement till about 60nm, after which movement slows down and scission occurs. That scission occurs at shorter invaginations lengths is confirmed by formation of smaller vesicles and shorter invagination lengths in rvs167deletion cells, quantified by Correlative light and electron microscopy (CLEM) (ref3wanda). Invagination lengths of 60nm is the time window for arrival of Rvs167 (ref3wanda), indicating that coat movement of endocytic sites in rvs167deletion cells progresses normally till the expected arrival of Rvs. 


\subsection{Rvs BAR domains recognize membrane curvature in-vivo}
The curved tertiary structure and liposome binding assays of N-BAR domains have suggested that they may have a preference for curved membrane that match their own intrinsic curvature. Alternately, they may also impose their curvature on flat membrane and induce curvature formation. In-vivo, the curvature interaction of Rvs167 has not been tested. In order to do so, we delete the SH3 domain of Rvs167 observe the localization of endogenously tagged Rvs167-eGFP and BAR-eGFP and Abp1-mCherry in WT and sla2deletion cells. Sla2 acts as the molecular linker between forces exerted by the actin network and the plasma membrane. Sla2deletion cells therefore have a polymerizing actin network, but the membrane remains flat and endocytosis fails. In these cells, the full-length Rvs167 protein co-localizes with Abp1-mCherry, indicating that it is recruited to endocytic sites. BAR-eGFP localization is removed, except for rare transient patches that do not co-localize with Abp1-mCherry.

\end{figure}


\subsection{Rvs SH3 domains contribute to curvature independent localization}
We have shown that BAR domains need membrane curvature to localize. Full-length Rvs167, however, is recruited to endocytic patches in sla2deletion cells. This indicates that a second interaction, that is not the BAR-curvature dependent, recruits the protein to endocytic sites. This interaction must come from the SH3 region, showing that Rvs localization is dependent on both BAR as well as SH3 domain interactions. Absence of the SH3 domain also reduces total recruitment of Rvs and Abp1 protein, giving the SH3 domain an important and surprising role in regulating the late stage of endocytosis. 

\subsection{SH3 domains are recruited by Myosin 5}
SH3 domains have been shown to interact with several proteins in the actin module of endocytosis: Las17, type I myosins, and Vrp1 all have genetic or physical interactions with Rvs167 SH3 domains (Lila and Drubin, 1997; Colwill et al., 1999, Madania et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2009). 
We tested the interaction by studying the localization of full-length Rvs167 in cells with one of these proteins deleted, and treated with Las17 to reproduce the situation in which BAR-curvature interaction is removed. 
As seen in (some figure), deletion of neither Las17 nor Myo3 in combination with LatA treatment does not remove the localization of Rvs167. Deletion of Vrp1 and Myo5, with LatA treatment removes localization of Rvs167. Since Vrp1 is required for the recruitment of Myo5 (refMyo5), SH3 domains interact with Myo5 rather than Vrp1. 
\subsubsection{\color{red} 
	what about the differences in myo5 and myo3 number... if the Rvs recruitment only slightly depended on myo3 we probably wouldnt see a difference

\subsection{Increased BAR domain recruitment corresponds to increased membrane movement}
The decreased Sla1 movement in BAR cells can be explained by a loss of interaction of the SH3 domain, or by reduced recruitment of the  BAR domains. To check whether increasing the recruitment of the Rvs complex alone can rescue reduced Sla1 movement, the Rvs167 and Rvs161 ORF was duplicated endogenously (ref Huber dude) in diploid and haploid yeast cells. In diploid cells, Rvs duplication results in either 4x copies of both Rvs genes, 2x copies (WT diploid) or 1x copies, in which one gene of Rvs167 and Rvs161 are deleted. We show that amount of Rvs167 recruited to sites increases linearly, without changing either the rate of movement or total movement before scission of Sla1. 
Similarly, in haploid cells, increasing the gene copy of Rvs167 and Rvs161 results in increased recruitment of Rvs167, without influencing the dynamics of Sla1. Expressing two instead of one copy of the Rvs167 BAR domain alone rescues the loss of Sla1 movement in the 1x copy of BAR domain alone, as well the inward jump of BAR-GFP itself. The loss of inward movement in 1xBAR suggests that smaller vesicles are produced in these cells, confirmed by CLEM. This would in corollary indicate that the increased inward movement in 2xBAR produces WT-sized vesicles.

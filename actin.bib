abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton and actin-coupled endocytosis are conserved cellular processes required for the normal growth and pathogenesis of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We have previously shown that both actin-regulating kinase MoArk1 and adenylyl cyclase-associated protein MoCap1 regulate actin dynamics and endocytosis to play a key role in virulence of the fungus. To understand the underlying mechanism, we have characterized the actin-binding protein MoAbp1 that interacts with MoArk1 from M. oryzae. The $\Delta$Moabp1 mutant exhibited delayed endocytosis and defects in the growth, host penetration, and invasive growth. Consistent with its putative function associated with actin-binding, MoAbp1 regulates the localization of actin patches and plays a role in MoArk1 phosphorylation. In addition, MoAbp1 interacts with MoCap1 affecting its normal patch localization pattern and the actin protein MoAct1 through its conserved domains. Taken together, our results support a notion that MoAbp1 functions as a protein scaffold linking MoArk1, MoCap1 and MoAct1 to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics critical in growth and pathogenicity of the blast fungus.},

@article{Geli2000,
abstract = {The yeast type I myosins (MYO3 and MYO5) are involved in endocytosis and in the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. The tail of these proteins contains a Tail Homology 2 (TH2) domain that constitutes a putative actin-binding site. Because of the important mechanistic implications of a second ATP-independent actin-binding site, we analyzed its functional relevance in vivo. Even though the myosin tail interacts with actin, and this interaction seems functionally important, deletion of a major portion of the TH2 domain did not abolish interaction. In contrast, we found that the SH3 domain of Myo5p significantly contributes to this interaction, implicating other proteins. We found that Vrp1p, the yeast homolog of WIP [Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-interacting protein], seems necessary to sustain the Myo5p tail-F-actin interaction. Consistent with recent results implicating the yeast type I myosins in regulating actin polymerization in vivo, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of Myo5p is able to induce cytosol-dependent actin polymerization in vitro, and that this activity requires both an intact Myo5p SH3 domain and Vrp1p.},

@article{Sun2006,
abstract = {Actin polymerization essential for endocytic internalization in budding yeast is controlled by four nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) that each exhibits a unique dynamic behavior at endocytic sites. How each NPF functions and is regulated to restrict actin assembly to late stages of endocytic internalization is not known. Quantitative analysis of NPF biochemical activities, and genetic analysis of recruitment and regulatory mechanisms, defined a linear pathway in which protein composition changes at endocytic sites control actin assembly and function. We show that yeast WASP initiates actin assembly at endocytic sites and that this assembly and the recruitment of a yeast WIP-like protein by WASP recruit a type I myosin with both NPF and motor activities. Importantly, type I myosin motor and NPF activities are separable, and both contribute to endocytic coat inward movement, which likely represents membrane invagination. These results reveal a mechanism in which actin nucleation and myosin motor activity cooperate to promote endocytic internalization.},

@article{Huckaba2004,
abstract = {Using FM4-64 to label endosomes and Abp1p-GFP or Sac6p-GFP to label actin patches, we find that (1) endosomes colocalize with actin patches as they assemble at the bud cortex; (2) endosomes colocalize with actin patches as they undergo linear, retrograde movement from buds toward mother cells; and (3) actin patches interact with and disassemble at FM4-64–labeled internal compartments. We also show that retrograde flow of actin cables mediates retrograde actin patch movement. An Arp2/3 complex mutation decreases the frequency of cortical, nonlinear actin patch movements, but has no effect on the velocity of linear, retrograde actin patch movement. Rather, linear actin patch movement occurs at the same velocity and direction as the movement of actin cables. Moreover, actin patches require actin cables for retrograde movements and colocalize with actin cables as they undergo retrograde movement. Our studies support a mechanism whereby actin cables serve as “conveyor belts” for retrograde movement and delivery of actin patches/endosomes to FM4-64–labeled internal compartments.},

@article{Skruzny2012,
abstract = {Dynamic actin filaments are a crucial component of clathrin-mediated endocytosis when endocytic proteins cannot supply enough energy for vesicle budding. Actin cytoskeleton is thought to provide force for membrane invagination or vesicle scission, but how this force is transmitted to the plasma membrane is not understood. Here we describe the molecular mechanism of plasma membrane-actin cytoskeleton coupling mediated by cooperative action of epsin Ent1 and the HIP1R homolog Sla2 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sla2 anchors Ent1 to a stable endocytic coat by an unforeseen interaction between Sla2's ANTH and Ent1's ENTH lipid-binding domains. The ANTH and ENTH domains bind each other in a ligand-dependent manner to provide critical anchoring of both proteins to the membrane. The C-terminal parts of Ent1 and Sla2 bind redundantly to actin filaments via a previously unknown phospho-regulated actin-binding domain in Ent1 and the THATCH domain in Sla2. By the synergistic binding to the membrane and redundant interaction with actin, Ent1 and Sla2 form an essential molecular linker that transmits the force generated by the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, leading to membrane invagination and vesicle budding.},

@article{Minc2009,
abstract = {Mechanical properties of fungal cells participate in the control of cell size, morphogenesis and function [-]. Tip growth can be understood by a viscoelastic model in which growth is derived by high internal turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity. To understand how these properties regulate growth in the rod-shaped fission yeast Schizosaccaromyces pombe, we measure key parameters by using femtoliter cylindrical PDMS microchambers with varying elasticity as force sensors for single cells. By buckling cells in these chambers, we determine the elastic surface modulus of the cell wall to be 20.2 ± 6.1 N.m-1. By analyzing the growth as they push against the walls of the chamber, we derive force-velocity relationships and values for internal effective turgor pressure of 0.85 ± 0.15 MPa and a growth stalling force of 11 ± 3 $\mu$N. The behavior of cells buckling under the force of their own growth provides an independent test of this model and parameters. Force generation is dependent on turgor pressure and a glycerol synthesis gene gpd1+ (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and is independent of actin cables. This study develops a quantitative framework for tip cell growth and characterize mechanisms of force generation that could contribute, for instance, in fungal invasion into host tissues.},

@article{Aghamohammadazadeh2009,
abstract = {Key features of clathrin-mediated endocytosis have been conserved across evolution. However, endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is completely dependent on a functional actin cytoskeleton, while actin appears to be less critical in mammalian cell endocytosis. We reveal that the fundamental requirement for actin in early stages of yeast endocytosis is to provide a strong framework to support force generation required to direct the invaginating plasma membrane into the cell against turgor pressure. By providing osmotic support, pressure differences across the plasma membrane were removed and this reduced the requirement for actin-bundling proteins required for normal endocytosis. Conversely, increased turgor pressure in specific yeast mutants correlated with decreased rate of endocytic patch invagination.},

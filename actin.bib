abstract = {Yeast Las17 protein is homologous to the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein, which is implicated in severe immunodeficiency. Las17p/Bee1p has been shown to be important for actin patch assembly and actin polymerization. Here we show that Las17p interacts with the Arp2/3 complex. LAS17 is an allele-specific multicopy suppressor of ARP2 and ARP3 mutations; overexpression restores both actin patch organization and endocytosis defects in ARP2 temperature-sensitive (ts) cells. Six of seven ARP2 ts mutants and at least one ARP3 ts mutant are synthetically lethal with las17Delta ts confirming functional interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. Further characterization of las17Delta cells showed that receptor-mediated internalization of alpha factor by the Ste2 receptor is severely defective. The polarity of normal bipolar bud site selection is lost. Las17-gfp remains localized in cortical patches in vivo independently of polymerized actin and is required for the polarized localization of Arp2/3 as well as actin. Coimmunoprecipitation of Arp2p with Las17p indicates that Las17p interacts directly with the complex. Two hybrid results also suggest that Las17p interacts with actin, verprolin, Rvs167p and several other proteins including Src homology 3 (SH3) domain proteins, suggesting that Las17p may integrate signals from different regulatory cascades destined for the Arp2/3p complex and the actin cytoskeleton.},

@article{Huckaba2004,
abstract = {Using FM4-64 to label endosomes and Abp1p-GFP or Sac6p-GFP to label actin patches, we find that (1) endosomes colocalize with actin patches as they assemble at the bud cortex; (2) endosomes colocalize with actin patches as they undergo linear, retrograde movement from buds toward mother cells; and (3) actin patches interact with and disassemble at FM4-64–labeled internal compartments. We also show that retrograde flow of actin cables mediates retrograde actin patch movement. An Arp2/3 complex mutation decreases the frequency of cortical, nonlinear actin patch movements, but has no effect on the velocity of linear, retrograde actin patch movement. Rather, linear actin patch movement occurs at the same velocity and direction as the movement of actin cables. Moreover, actin patches require actin cables for retrograde movements and colocalize with actin cables as they undergo retrograde movement. Our studies support a mechanism whereby actin cables serve as “conveyor belts” for retrograde movement and delivery of actin patches/endosomes to FM4-64–labeled internal compartments.},

@article{Aghamohammadazadeh2009,
abstract = {Key features of clathrin-mediated endocytosis have been conserved across evolution. However, endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is completely dependent on a functional actin cytoskeleton, while actin appears to be less critical in mammalian cell endocytosis. We reveal that the fundamental requirement for actin in early stages of yeast endocytosis is to provide a strong framework to support force generation required to direct the invaginating plasma membrane into the cell against turgor pressure. By providing osmotic support, pressure differences across the plasma membrane were removed and this reduced the requirement for actin-bundling proteins required for normal endocytosis. Conversely, increased turgor pressure in specific yeast mutants correlated with decreased rate of endocytic patch invagination.},

@article{Minc2009,
abstract = {Mechanical properties of fungal cells participate in the control of cell size, morphogenesis and function [-]. Tip growth can be understood by a viscoelastic model in which growth is derived by high internal turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity. To understand how these properties regulate growth in the rod-shaped fission yeast Schizosaccaromyces pombe, we measure key parameters by using femtoliter cylindrical PDMS microchambers with varying elasticity as force sensors for single cells. By buckling cells in these chambers, we determine the elastic surface modulus of the cell wall to be 20.2 ± 6.1 N.m-1. By analyzing the growth as they push against the walls of the chamber, we derive force-velocity relationships and values for internal effective turgor pressure of 0.85 ± 0.15 MPa and a growth stalling force of 11 ± 3 $\mu$N. The behavior of cells buckling under the force of their own growth provides an independent test of this model and parameters. Force generation is dependent on turgor pressure and a glycerol synthesis gene gpd1+ (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and is independent of actin cables. This study develops a quantitative framework for tip cell growth and characterize mechanisms of force generation that could contribute, for instance, in fungal invasion into host tissues.},

abstract = {Coordination between sequential steps in synaptic vesicle endocytosis, including clathrin coat formation, fission, and uncoating, appears to involve protein–protein interactions. Here, we show that compounds that disrupt interactions of the SH3 domain of endophilin with dynamin and synaptojanin impair synaptic vesicle endocytosis in a living synapse. Two distinct endocytic intermediates accumulated. Free clathrin-coated vesicles were induced by a peptide-blocking endophilin's SH3 domain and by antibodies to the proline-rich domain (PRD) of synaptojanin. Invaginated clathrin-coated pits were induced by the same peptide and by the SH3 domain of endophilin. We suggest that the SH3 domain of endophilin participates in both fission and uncoating and that it may be a key component of a molecular switch that couples the fission reaction to uncoating.},

abstract = {Dynamin 1 is a neuron-specific guanosine triphosphatase thought to be critically required for the fission reaction of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Unexpectedly, mice lacking dynamin 1 were able to form functional synapses, even though their postnatal viability was limited. However, during spontaneous network activity, branched, tubular plasma membrane invaginations accumulated, capped by clathrin-coated pits, in synapses of dynamin 1-knockout mice. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis was severely impaired during strong exogenous stimulation but resumed efficiently when the stimulus was terminated. Thus, dynamin 1-independent mechanisms can support limited synaptic vesicle endocytosis, but dynamin 1 is needed during high levels of neuronal activity.},

abstract = {The large GTPase dynamin is the first protein shown to catalyze membrane fission. Dynamin and its related proteins are essential to many cell functions, from endocytosis to organelle division and fusion, and it plays a critical role in many physiological functions such as synaptic transmission and muscle contraction. Research of the past three decades has focused on understanding how dynamin works. In this review, we present the basis for an emerging consensus on how dynamin functions. Three properties of dynamin are strongly supported by experimental data: first, dynamin oligomerizes into a helical polymer; second, dynamin oligomer constricts in the presence of GTP; and third, dynamin catalyzes membrane fission upon GTP hydrolysis. We present the two current models for fission, essentially diverging in how GTP energy is spent. We further discuss how future research might solve the remaining open questions presently under discussion.},

To determine the functional relationship between these proteins and dynamin, we have analyzed endocytic intermediates that accumulate in cells that lack dynamin (derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice). In these cells, actin-nucleating proteins, actin, and BAR domain proteins accumulate at the base of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where they support the growth of dynamic long tubular necks. These results, which we show reflect the sequence of events in wild-type cells, demonstrate a concerted action of these proteins prior to, and independent of, dynamin and emphasize similarities between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Our data also demonstrate that the relationship between dynamin and actin is intimately connected to dynamin's endocytic role and that dynamin terminates a powerful actin- and BAR protein-dependent tubulating activity.},

Here, using a cell-free system, we provide direct morphological evidence in support of this hypothesis. Unexpectedly, we also find that amphiphysin-1, like dynamin-1, can transform spherical liposomes into narrow tubules. Moreover, amphiphysin-1 assembles with dynamin-1 into ring-like structures around the tubules and enhances the liposome-fragmenting activity of dynamin-1 in the presence of GTP. These results show that amphiphysin binds lipid bilayers, indicate a potential function for amphiphysin in the changes in bilayer curvature that accompany vesicle budding, and imply a close functional partnership between amphiphysin and dynamin in endocytosis.},

Here, we provide direct evidence for cooperative membrane recruitment of dynamin with the BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) proteins, endophilin and amphiphysin. Surprisingly, endophilin and amphiphysin recruitment to membranes was also dependent on binding to dynamin due to auto-inhibition of BAR-membrane interactions. Consistent with reciprocal recruitment in vitro, dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane in cells was strongly reduced by concomitant depletion of endophilin and amphiphysin, and conversely, depletion of dynamin dramatically reduced the recruitment of endophilin. In addition, amphiphysin depletion was observed to severely inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, GTP-dependent membrane scission by dynamin was dramatically elevated by BAR domain proteins. Thus, BAR domain proteins and dynamin act in synergy in membrane recruitment and GTP-dependent vesicle scission.},

abstract = {The yeast dynamin Vps1 acts cooperatively with many proteins at diverse cellular locations for endocytosis, protein sorting, and membrane fusion and fission. It has been proposed that Vps1 is functionally linked to clathrin heavy chain 1 (Chc1), but the question of how, where, and when they function together remains unknown. Here we report that Vps1 arrives at the Golgi after clathrin, and that loss of Vps1 leads to a shift in the cellular localization of clathrin to the late endosome and vacuole, not vice versa. Our two-hybrid-based approach provides evidence that full-length Vps1 and its truncated versions bind to the C-terminal region of the Chc1. Cells lacking both Vps1 and Chc1 displayed more severe defects in carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) sorting at the Golgi than those in Vps1-deficient cells. Further, these Vps1 fragments became dominant-negative for CPY sorting upon overexpression. These results suggest that Vps1 binds to Chc1 and functions together at the Golgi for efficient Golgi-to-endosome membrane trafficking. In addition, we found that Vps1, without the aid of clathrin, plays a role in controlling the number and turnover of late Golgi.},

In the budding yeast, there are recycling traffics from early and late endosomal compartments to the late Golgi. Here, we examined a possible role for Vps1, a large GTPase, in the recycling traffic of GFP-Snc1 from early endosomes to the late Golgi. In the absence of Vps1 we observed an aberrant accumulation of GFP-Snc1 puncta in the cytoplasm that we identified as early endosomes. The N-terminal GTPase and the C-terminal GED domains of Vps1 are essential for Vps1's function in Snc1 recycling. Our finding of genetic interactions of VPS1 with genes involved in early endosome-to-Golgi traffic further suggests Vps1 functions as a recycling factor in the membrane traffic. Finally, we provide evidence that the severe accumulation of GFP-Snc1 cytoplasmic puncta in vps1$\Delta$ cells is attributed to a mild defect in the retention of the GARP component Vps51 at the late Golgi, as well as a severe disruption of actin cables.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Dynamin is a large GTPase that forms a helical collar at the neck of endocytic pits, and catalyzes membrane fission (Schmid and Frolov, 2011; Ferguson and De Camilli, 2012). Dynamin fission reaction is strictly dependent on GTP hydrolysis, but how fission is mediated is still debated (Antonny et al., 2016): GTP energy could be spent in membrane constriction required for fission, or in disassembly of the dynamin polymer to trigger fission. To follow dynamin GTP hydrolysis at endocytic pits, we generated a conformation-specific nanobody called dynab, that binds preferentially to the GTP hydrolytic state of dynamin-1. Dynab allowed us to follow the GTPase activity of dynamin-1 in real-time. We show that in fibroblasts, dynamin GTP hydrolysis occurs as stochastic bursts, which are randomly distributed relatively to the peak of dynamin assembly. Thus, dynamin disassembly is not coupled to GTPase activity, supporting that the GTP energy is primarily spent in constriction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Centronuclear myopathies are characterized by muscle weakness and abnormal centralization of nuclei in muscle fibers not secondary to regeneration. The severe neonatal X-linked form (myotubular myopathy) is due to mutations in the phosphoinositide phosphatase myotubularin (MTM1), whereas mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) have been found in some autosomal dominant cases. By direct sequencing of functional candidate genes, we identified homozygous mutations in amphiphysin 2 (BIN1) in three families with autosomal recessive inheritance. Two missense mutations affecting the BAR (Bin1/amphiphysin/RVS167) domain disrupt its membrane tubulation properties in transfected cells, and a partial truncation of the C-terminal SH3 domain abrogates the interaction with DNM2 and its recruitment to the membrane tubules. Our results suggest that mutations in BIN1 cause centronuclear myopathy by interfering with remodeling of T tubules and/or endocytic membranes, and that the functional interaction between BIN1 and DNM2 is necessary for normal muscle function and positioning of nuclei.},

abstract = {Dynamins are a conserved family of proteins involved in many membrane fusion and fission events. Previously, the dynamin-related protein Vps1 was shown to localize to endocytic sites, and yeast carrying deletions for genes encoding both the BAR domain protein Rvs167 and Vps1 had a more severe endocytic scission defect than either deletion alone. Vps1 and Rvs167 localize to endocytic sites at the onset of invagination and disassemble concomitant with inward vesicle movement. Rvs167-GFP localization is reduced in cells lacking vps1 suggesting that Vps1 influences Rvs167 association with the endocytic complex. Unlike classical dynamins, Vps1 does not have a proline–arginine domain that could interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins. Thus, while Rvs167 has an SH3 domain, it is not clear how an interaction would be mediated. Here, we demonstrate an interaction between Rvs167 SH3 domain and the single type ISH3-binding motif in Vps1. Mutant Vps1 that cannot bind Rvs167 rescues all membrane fusion/fission functions associated with Vps1 except for endocytic function, demonstrating the specificity and mechanistic importance of the interaction. In vitro, an Rvs161/Rvs167 heterodimer can disassemble Vps1 oligomers. Overall, the data support the idea that Vps1 and the amphiphysins function together to mediate scission during endocytosis in yeast.},

Here, using a cell-free system, we provide direct morphological evidence in support of this hypothesis. Unexpectedly, we also find that amphiphysin-1, like dynamin-1, can transform spherical liposomes into narrow tubules. Moreover, amphiphysin-1 assembles with dynamin-1 into ring-like structures around the tubules and enhances the liposome-fragmenting activity of dynamin-1 in the presence of GTP. These results show that amphiphysin binds lipid bilayers, indicate a potential function for amphiphysin in the changes in bilayer curvature that accompany vesicle budding, and imply a close functional partnership between amphiphysin and dynamin in endocytosis.},

abstract = {Membrane fusion and fission are vital for eukaryotic life. For three decades, it has been proposed that fusion is mediated by fusion between the proximal leaflets of two bilayers (hemi-fusion) to produce a hemi-fused structure, followed by fusion between the distal leaflets, whereas fission is via hemi-fission, which also produces a hemi-fused structure, followed by full fission. This hypothesis remained unsupported owing to the lack of observation of hemi-fusion or hemi-fission in live cells. A competing fusion hypothesis involving protein-lined pore formation has also been proposed. Here we report the observation of a hemi-fused $\Omega$-shaped structure in live neuroendocrine chromaffin cells and pancreatic $\beta$-cells, visualized using confocal and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy. This structure is generated from fusion pore opening or closure (fission) at the plasma membrane. Unexpectedly, the transition to full fusion or fission is determined by competition between fusion and calcium/dynamin-dependent fission mechanisms, and is notably slow (seconds to tens of seconds) in a substantial fraction of the events. These results provide key missing evidence in support of the hemi-fusion and hemi-fission hypothesis in live cells, and reveal the hemi-fused intermediate as a key structure controlling fusion and fission, as fusion and fission mechanisms compete to determine the transition to fusion or fission.},

The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae expresses a single dynamin-related protein that functions in membrane trafficking, and is considered to play a similar role to Dyn-1 and Dyn-2 during scission of endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane. Large parts of the dynamin protein are highly conserved across species and this has enabled us in this study to select a number of disease causing mutations and to generate equivalent mutations in Vps1. We have then studied these mutants using both cellular and biochemical assays to ascertain functions of the protein that have been affected by the changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that the Vps1-G397R mutation (Dyn-2 G358R) disrupts protein oligomerization, Vps1-A447T (Dyn-1 A408T) affects the scission stage of endocytosis, while Vps1-R298L (Dyn-1 R256L) affects lipid binding specificity and possibly an early stage in endocytosis.

Results: Dynamin is recruited to membranes by BAR-­‐domain proteins, which in turn rely on interaction with dynamin to bind membranes . Conclusion : Membrane binding by dynamin and BAR - ­‐domain proteins is cooperative and stimulates dynamin and GTP dependent membrane scission. Significance : Indicates how membrane recruitment of endocytotic proteins is orchestrated and their activity regulated . Abstract Dynamin mediates various membrane fission events , including the scission of clathrin - ­‐coated vesicles . Here we provide direct evidence for cooperative membrane recruitment of dynamin with the BAR proteins , endophilin and amphiphysin . Surprisingly , endophilin and amphiphysin recruitment to membranes was also dependent on binding to dynamin due to auto - ­‐inhibition of BAR - ­‐membrane interactions . Consistent with reciprocal recruitment in vitro , dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane in cells was strongly reduced by concomitant depletion of endophilin and amphiphysin , and conversely , depletion of dynamin dramatically reduced the recruitment of endophilin . In addition amphiphysin depletion was observed to severely inhibit clathrin - ­‐mediated endocytosis . Furthermore , GTP - ­‐dependent membrane scission by dynamin was dramatically elevated by BAR domain proteins . Thus BAR domain proteins and dynamin act in synergy in membrane recruitment and GTP - ­‐dependent vesicle scission .},

By a combination of different approaches, selection of phage displayed peptide libraries, substitution analyses of peptides synthesized on cellulose membranes, and a peptide scan spanning a 252-residue long synaptojanin fragment, we have concluded that amphiphysin binds to two sites, PIRPSR and PTIPPR, whereas endophilin has a distinct preferred binding site, PKRPPPPR. The comparison of the results obtained by phage display and substitution analysis permitted the identification of proline and arginine at positions 4 and 6 in the PIRPSR and PTIPPR target sequence as the major determinants of the recognition specificity mediated by the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1. More complex is the structural rationalization of the preferred endophilin ligands where SH3 binding cannot be easily interpreted in the framework of the "classical" type I or type II SH3 binding models. Our results suggest that the binding repertoire of SH3 domains may be more complex than originally predicted.},

abstract = {Membrane fusion and fission are antagonistic reactions controlled by different proteins. Dynamins promote membrane fission by GTP-driven changes of conformation and polymerization state, while SNAREs fuse membranes by forming complexes between t- and v-SNAREs from apposed vesicles. Here, we describe a role of the dynamin-like GTPase Vps1p in fusion of yeast vacuoles. Vps1p forms polymers that couple several t-SNAREs together. At the onset of fusion, the SNARE-activating ATPase Sec18p/NSF and the t-SNARE depolymerize Vps1p and release it from the membrane. This activity is independent of the SNARE coactivator Sec17p/alpha-SNAP and of the v-SNARE. Vps1p release liberates the t-SNAREs for initiating fusion and at the same time disrupts fission activity. We propose that reciprocal control between fusion and fission components exists, which may prevent futile cycles of fission and fusion.},

@article{Bui2012,
abstract = {To initiate mitochondrial fission, dynamin-related proteins (DRPs) must bind specific adaptors on the outer mitochondrial membrane. The structural features underlying this interaction are poorly understood. Using yeast as a model, we show that the Insert B domain of the Dnm1 guanosine triphosphatase (a DRP) contains a novel motif required for association with the mitochondrial adaptor Mdv1. Mutation of this conserved motif specifically disrupted Dnm1-Mdv1 interactions, blocking Dnm1 recruitment and mitochondrial fission. Suppressor mutations in Mdv1 that restored Dnm1-Mdv1 interactions and fission identified potential protein-binding interfaces on the Mdv1 $\beta$-propeller domain. These results define the first known function for Insert B in DRP-adaptor interactions. Based on the variability of Insert B sequences and adaptor proteins, we propose that Insert B domains and mitochondrial adaptors have coevolved to meet the unique requirements for mitochondrial fission of different organisms.},

We identified an Mx-like protein in yeast and present genetic evidence for its cellular function. This protein, the VPS1 product, is essential for vacuolar protein sorting, normal organization of intracellular membranes, and growth at high temperature, implying that Mx-like proteins are engaged in fundamental cellular processes in eukaryotes. Vps1p contains a tripartite GTP binding motif, which suggests that binding to GTP is essential to its role in protein sorting. Vps1p-specific antibody labels punctate cytoplasmic structures that condense to larger structures in a Golgi-accumulating sec7 mutant; thus, Vps1p may associate with an intermediate organelle of the secretory pathway.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Dynamin, which mediates membrane fission during endocytosis, binds endophilin and other members of the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) protein family. How endophilin influences endocytic membrane fission is still unclear. Here we show that dynamin-mediated membrane fission is potently inhibited in vitro when an excess of endophilin co-assembles with dynamin around membrane tubules. We further show by electron microscopy that endophilin intercalates between turns of the dynamin helix and impairs fission by preventing trans interactions between dynamin rungs that are thought to play critical roles in membrane constriction. In living cells, overexpression of endophilin delayed both fission and transferrin uptake. Together, our observations suggest that while endophilin helps shape endocytic tubules and recruit dynamin to endocytic sites, it can also block membrane fission when present in excess by inhibiting inter-dynamin interactions. The sequence of recruitment and the relative stoichiometry of the two proteins may be critical to regulated endocytic fission.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Vater1992,
abstract = {The product of the VPS1 gene, Vps1p, is required for the sorting of soluble vacuolar proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate here that Vps1p, which contains a consensus tripartite motif for guanine nucleotide binding, is capable of binding and hydrolyzing GTP. Vps1p is a member of a subfamily of large GTP-binding proteins whose members include the vertebrate Mx proteins, the yeast MGM1 protein, the Drosophila melanogaster shibire protein, and dynamin, a bovine brain protein that bundles microtubules in vitro. Disruption of microtubules did not affect the fidelity or kinetics of vacuolar protein sorting, indicating that Vps1p function is not dependent on microtubules. Based on mutational analyses, we propose a two-domain model for Vps1p function. When VPS1 was treated with hydroxylamine, half of all mutations isolated were found to be dominant negative with respect to vacuolar protein sorting. All of the dominant-negative mutations analyzed further mapped to the amino-terminal half of Vps1p and gave rise to full-length protein products. In contrast, recessive mutations gave rise to truncated or unstable protein products. Two large deletion mutations in VPS1 were created to further investigate Vps1p function. A mutant form of Vps1p lacking the carboxy-terminal half of the protein retained the capacity to bind GTP and did not interfere with sorting in a wild-type background. A mutant form of Vps1p lacking the entire GTP-binding domain interfered with vacuolar protein sorting in wild-type cells. We suggest that the amino-terminal domain of Vps1p provides a GTP-binding and hydrolyzing activity required for vacuolar protein sorting, and the carboxy-terminal domain mediates Vps1p association with an as yet unidentified component of the sorting apparatus.},

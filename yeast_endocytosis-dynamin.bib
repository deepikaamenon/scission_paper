abstract = {The yeast dynamin Vps1 acts cooperatively with many proteins at diverse cellular locations for endocytosis, protein sorting, and membrane fusion and fission. It has been proposed that Vps1 is functionally linked to clathrin heavy chain 1 (Chc1), but the question of how, where, and when they function together remains unknown. Here we report that Vps1 arrives at the Golgi after clathrin, and that loss of Vps1 leads to a shift in the cellular localization of clathrin to the late endosome and vacuole, not vice versa. Our two-hybrid-based approach provides evidence that full-length Vps1 and its truncated versions bind to the C-terminal region of the Chc1. Cells lacking both Vps1 and Chc1 displayed more severe defects in carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) sorting at the Golgi than those in Vps1-deficient cells. Further, these Vps1 fragments became dominant-negative for CPY sorting upon overexpression. These results suggest that Vps1 binds to Chc1 and functions together at the Golgi for efficient Golgi-to-endosome membrane trafficking. In addition, we found that Vps1, without the aid of clathrin, plays a role in controlling the number and turnover of late Golgi.},

abstract = {Dynamins are a conserved family of proteins involved in membrane fusion and fission. Although mammalian dynamins are known to be involved in several membrane-trafficking events, the role of dynamin-1 in endocytosis is the best-characterised role of this protein family. Despite many similarities between endocytosis in yeast and mammalian cells, a comparable role for dynamins in yeast has not previously been demonstrated. The reported lack of involvement of dynamins in yeast endocytosis has raised questions over the general applicability of the current yeast model of endocytosis, and has also precluded studies using well-developed methods in yeast, to further our understanding of the mechanism of dynamin function during endocytosis. Here, we investigate the yeast dynamin-like protein Vps1 and demonstrate a transient burst of localisation to sites of endocytosis. Using live-cell imaging of endocytic reporters in strains lacking vps1, and also electron microscopy and biochemical approaches, we demonstrate a role for Vps1 in facilitating endocytic invagination. Vps1 mutants were generated, and analysis in several assays reveals a role for the C-terminal self-assembly domain in endocytosis but not in other membrane fission events with which Vps1 has previously been associated.},

abstract = {Amphiphysin, a protein that is highly concentrated in nerve terminals, has been proposed to function as a linker between the clathrin coat and dynamin in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Here, using a cell-free system, we provide direct morphological evidence in support of this hypothesis. Unexpectedly, we also find that amphiphysin-1, like dynamin-1, can transform spherical liposomes into narrow tubules. Moreover, amphiphysin-1 assembles with dynamin-1 into ring-like structures around the tubules and enhances the liposome-fragmenting activity of dynamin-1 in the presence of GTP. These results show that amphiphysin binds lipid bilayers, indicate a potential function for amphiphysin in the changes in bilayer curvature that accompany vesicle budding, and imply a close functional partnership between amphiphysin and dynamin in endocytosis.},

However, these models are not mutually exclusive and subsequent studies have provided evidence for both dynamin functions.

abstract = {Recycling of cellular membranes and their constituents plays a role for cell survival and growth. In the budding yeast, there are recycling traffics from early and late endosomal compartments to the late Golgi. Here, we examined a possible role for Vps1, a large GTPase, in the recycling traffic of GFP-Snc1 from early endosomes to the late Golgi. In the absence of Vps1 we observed an aberrant accumulation of GFP-Snc1 puncta in the cytoplasm that we identified as early endosomes. The N-terminal GTPase and the C-terminal GED domains of Vps1 are essential for Vps1's function in Snc1 recycling. Our finding of genetic interactions of VPS1 with genes involved in early endosome-to-Golgi traffic further suggests Vps1 functions as a recycling factor in the membrane traffic. Finally, we provide evidence that the severe accumulation of GFP-Snc1 cytoplasmic puncta in vps1$\Delta$ cells is attributed to a mild defect in the retention of the GARP component Vps51 at the late Golgi, as well as a severe disruption of actin cables.},

Dynamin and its related proteins are essential to many cell functions, from endocytosis to organelle division and fusion, and it plays a critical role in many physiological functions such as synaptic transmission and muscle contraction. Research of the past three decades has focused on understanding how dynamin works. In this review, we present the basis for an emerging consensus on how dynamin functions. Three properties of dynamin are strongly supported by experimental data: first, dynamin oligomerizes into a helical polymer; second, dynamin oligomer constricts in the presence of GTP; and third, dynamin catalyzes membrane fission upon GTP hydrolysis. We present the two current models for fission, essentially diverging in how GTP energy is spent. We further discuss how future research might solve the remaining open questions presently under discussion.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Dynamin, which mediates membrane fission during endocytosis, binds endophilin and other members of the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) protein family. How endophilin influences endocytic membrane fission is still unclear. Here we show that dynamin-mediated membrane fission is potently inhibited in vitro when an excess of endophilin co-assembles with dynamin around membrane tubules. We further show by electron microscopy that endophilin intercalates between turns of the dynamin helix and impairs fission by preventing trans interactions between dynamin rungs that are thought to play critical roles in membrane constriction. In living cells, overexpression of endophilin delayed both fission and transferrin uptake. Together, our observations suggest that while endophilin helps shape endocytic tubules and recruit dynamin to endocytic sites, it can also block membrane fission when present in excess by inhibiting inter-dynamin interactions. The sequence of recruitment and the relative stoichiometry of the two proteins may be critical to regulated endocytic fission.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Nicot2007,
abstract = {Centronuclear myopathies are characterized by muscle weakness and abnormal centralization of nuclei in muscle fibers not secondary to regeneration. The severe neonatal X-linked form (myotubular myopathy) is due to mutations in the phosphoinositide phosphatase myotubularin (MTM1), whereas mutations in dynamin 2 (DNM2) have been found in some autosomal dominant cases. By direct sequencing of functional candidate genes, we identified homozygous mutations in amphiphysin 2 (BIN1) in three families with autosomal recessive inheritance. Two missense mutations affecting the BAR (Bin1/amphiphysin/RVS167) domain disrupt its membrane tubulation properties in transfected cells, and a partial truncation of the C-terminal SH3 domain abrogates the interaction with DNM2 and its recruitment to the membrane tubules. Our results suggest that mutations in BIN1 cause centronuclear myopathy by interfering with remodeling of T tubules and/or endocytic membranes, and that the functional interaction between BIN1 and DNM2 is necessary for normal muscle function and positioning of nuclei.},

@article{Takei1999,
abstract = {Amphiphysin, a protein that is highly concentrated in nerve terminals, has been proposed to function as a linker between the clathrin coat and dynamin in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Here, using a cell-free system, we provide direct morphological evidence in support of this hypothesis. Unexpectedly, we also find that amphiphysin-1, like dynamin-1, can transform spherical liposomes into narrow tubules. Moreover, amphiphysin-1 assembles with dynamin-1 into ring-like structures around the tubules and enhances the liposome-fragmenting activity of dynamin-1 in the presence of GTP. These results show that amphiphysin binds lipid bilayers, indicate a potential function for amphiphysin in the changes in bilayer curvature that accompany vesicle budding, and imply a close functional partnership between amphiphysin and dynamin in endocytosis.},

@article{Vater1992,
abstract = {The product of the VPS1 gene, Vps1p, is required for the sorting of soluble vacuolar proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate here that Vps1p, which contains a consensus tripartite motif for guanine nucleotide binding, is capable of binding and hydrolyzing GTP. Vps1p is a member of a subfamily of large GTP-binding proteins whose members include the vertebrate Mx proteins, the yeast MGM1 protein, the Drosophila melanogaster shibire protein, and dynamin, a bovine brain protein that bundles microtubules in vitro. Disruption of microtubules did not affect the fidelity or kinetics of vacuolar protein sorting, indicating that Vps1p function is not dependent on microtubules. Based on mutational analyses, we propose a two-domain model for Vps1p function. When VPS1 was treated with hydroxylamine, half of all mutations isolated were found to be dominant negative with respect to vacuolar protein sorting. All of the dominant-negative mutations analyzed further mapped to the amino-terminal half of Vps1p and gave rise to full-length protein products. In contrast, recessive mutations gave rise to truncated or unstable protein products. Two large deletion mutations in VPS1 were created to further investigate Vps1p function. A mutant form of Vps1p lacking the carboxy-terminal half of the protein retained the capacity to bind GTP and did not interfere with sorting in a wild-type background. A mutant form of Vps1p lacking the entire GTP-binding domain interfered with vacuolar protein sorting in wild-type cells. We suggest that the amino-terminal domain of Vps1p provides a GTP-binding and hydrolyzing activity required for vacuolar protein sorting, and the carboxy-terminal domain mediates Vps1p association with an as yet unidentified component of the sorting apparatus.},

abstract = {The yeast dynamin-related GTPase Vps1 has been implicated in a range of cellular functions including vacuolar protein sorting, protein trafficking, organization of peroxisome and endocytosis.1,2 Vps1 is present at endocytic sites and may be directly involved in endocytic vesicle invagination through its membrane-tubulating activity. Here, evidence supporting the functional link between Vps1 and the yeast amphiphysin Rvs167 in vesicle invagination is discussed. Though the disassembly of endocytic factors from pinched-off endocytic vesicles appears to be tightly regulated in a spatiotemporal manner, we are far from having complete understanding of the underlying mechanism. In this study, we provide evidence that Vps1 plays a role in the uncoating of endocytic proteins from post-internalized vesicles, based on the observation of a quick disassembly of two endocytic coat proteins Ent1 and Ent2 in cells lacking Vps1.},

abstract = {Dynamins are a conserved family of proteins involved in many membrane fusion and fission events. Previously, the dynamin-related protein Vps1 was shown to localize to endocytic sites, and yeast carrying deletions for genes encoding both the BAR domain protein Rvs167 and Vps1 had a more severe endocytic scission defect than either deletion alone. Vps1 and Rvs167 localize to endocytic sites at the onset of invagination and disassemble concomitant with inward vesicle movement. Rvs167-GFP localization is reduced in cells lacking vps1 suggesting that Vps1 influences Rvs167 association with the endocytic complex. Unlike classical dynamins, Vps1 does not have a proline–arginine domain that could interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins. Thus, while Rvs167 has an SH3 domain, it is not clear how an interaction would be mediated. Here, we demonstrate an interaction between Rvs167 SH3 domain and the single type ISH3-binding motif in Vps1. Mutant Vps1 that cannot bind Rvs167 rescues all membrane fusion/fission functions associated with Vps1 except for endocytic function, demonstrating the specificity and mechanistic importance of the interaction. In vitro, an Rvs161/Rvs167 heterodimer can disassemble Vps1 oligomers. Overall, the data support the idea that Vps1 and the amphiphysins function together to mediate scission during endocytosis in yeast.},

abstract = {The GTPase dynamin, a key player in endocytic membrane fission, interacts with numerous proteins that regulate actin dynamics and generate/sense membrane curvature. To determine the functional relationship between these proteins and dynamin, we have analyzed endocytic intermediates that accumulate in cells that lack dynamin (derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice). In these cells, actin-nucleating proteins, actin, and BAR domain proteins accumulate at the base of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where they support the growth of dynamic long tubular necks. These results, which we show reflect the sequence of events in wild-type cells, demonstrate a concerted action of these proteins prior to, and independent of, dynamin and emphasize similarities between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Our data also demonstrate that the relationship between dynamin and actin is intimately connected to dynamin's endocytic role and that dynamin terminates a powerful actin- and BAR protein-dependent tubulating activity.},

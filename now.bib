abstract = {During endocytosis, actin-dependent forces are needed to oppose internal turgor pressure for invagination of the plasma membrane. Live-cell imaging shows that addition of sorbitol to the medium significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process and rescues defects of endocytic mutants in fission yeast., Yeast and other walled cells possess high internal turgor pressure that allows them to grow and survive in the environment. This turgor pressure, however, may oppose the invagination of the plasma membrane needed for endocytosis. Here we study the effects of turgor pressure on endocytosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by time-lapse imaging of individual endocytic sites. Decreasing effective turgor pressure by addition of sorbitol to the media significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process before actin assembly and membrane ingression but does not affect the velocity or depth of ingression of the endocytic pit in wild-type cells. Sorbitol also rescues endocytic ingression defects of certain endocytic mutants and of cells treated with a low dose of the actin inhibitor latrunculin A. Endocytosis proceeds after removal of the cell wall, suggesting that the cell wall does not contribute mechanically to this process. These studies suggest that endocytosis is governed by a mechanical balance between local actin-dependent inward forces and opposing forces from high internal turgor pressure on the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Dual colour total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool for decoding the molecular dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Typically, the recruitment of a fluorescent protein-tagged endocytic protein was referenced to the disappearance of spot-like clathrin-coated structure (CCS), but the precision of spot-like CCS disappearance as a marker for canonical CME remained unknown. Here we have used an imaging assay based on total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to detect scission events with a resolution of ∼ 2 s. We found that scission events engulfed comparable amounts of transferrin receptor cargo at CCSs of different sizes and CCS did not always disappear following scission. We measured the recruitment dynamics of 34 types of endocytic protein to scission events: Abp1, ACK1, amphiphysin1, APPL1, Arp3, BIN1, CALM, CIP4, clathrin light chain (Clc), cofilin, coronin1B, cortactin, dynamin1/2, endophilin2, Eps15, Eps8, epsin2, FBP17, FCHo1/2, GAK, Hip1R, lifeAct, mu2 subunit of the AP2 complex, myosin1E, myosin6, NECAP, N-WASP, OCRL1, Rab5, SNX9, synaptojanin2$\beta$1, and syndapin2. For each protein we aligned ∼ 1,000 recruitment profiles to their respective scission events and constructed characteristic "recruitment signatures" that were grouped, as for yeast, to reveal the modular organization of mammalian CME. A detailed analysis revealed the unanticipated recruitment dynamics of SNX9, FBP17, and CIP4 and showed that the same set of proteins was recruited, in the same order, to scission events at CCSs of different sizes and lifetimes. Collectively these data reveal the fine-grained temporal structure of CME and suggest a simplified canonical model of mammalian CME in which the same core mechanism of CME, involving actin, operates at CCSs of diverse sizes and lifetimes.},

abstract = {Endocytic budding implies the remodeling of a plasma membrane portion from a flat sheet to a closed vesicle. Clathrin- and actin-mediated endocytosis in yeast has proven a very powerful model to study this process, with more than 60 evolutionarily conserved proteins involved in fashioning primary endocytic vesicles. Major progress in the field has been made during the last decades by defining the sequential recruitment of the endocytic machinery at the cell cortex using live-cell fluorescence microscopy. Higher spatial resolution has been recently achieved by developing time-resolved electron microscopy methods, allowing for the first time the visualization of changes in the plasma membrane shape, coupled to the dynamics of the endocytic machinery. Here, we highlight these advances and review recent findings from yeast and mammals that have increased our understanding of where and how endocytic proteins may apply force to remodel the plasma membrane during different stages of the process.},

abstract = {SNARE proteins zipper to form complexes (SNAREpins) that power vesicle fusion with target membranes in a variety of biological processes. A single SNAREpin takes about 1 s to fuse two bilayers, yet a handful can ensure release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles much faster: in a 10th of a millisecond. We propose that, similar to the case of muscle myosins, the ultrafast fusion results from cooperative action of many SNAREpins. The coupling originates from mechanical interactions induced by confining scaffolds. Each SNAREpin is known to have enough energy to overcome the fusion barrier of 25-[Formula: see text]; however, the fusion barrier only becomes relevant when the SNAREpins are nearly completely zippered, and from this state, each SNAREpin can deliver only a small fraction of this energy as mechanical work. Therefore, they have to act cooperatively, and we show that at least three of them are needed to ensure fusion in less than a millisecond. However, to reach the prefusion state collectively, starting from the experimentally observed half-zippered metastable state, the SNAREpins have to mechanically synchronize, which takes more time as the number of SNAREpins increases. Incorporating this somewhat counterintuitive idea in a simple coarse-grained model results in the prediction that there should be an optimum number of SNAREpins for submillisecond fusion: three to six over a wide range of parameters. Interestingly, in situ cryoelectron microscope tomography has very recently shown that exactly six SNAREpins participate in the fusion of each synaptic vesicle. This number is in the range predicted by our theory.},

@article{Bitsikas2014,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Several different endocytic pathways have been proposed to function in mammalian cells. Clathrin-coated pits are well defined, but the identity, mechanism and function of alternative pathways have been controversial. Here we apply universal chemical labelling of plasma membrane proteins to define all primary endocytic vesicles, and labelling of specific proteins with a reducible SNAP-tag substrate. These approaches provide high temporal resolution and stringent discrimination between surface-connected and intracellular membranes. We find that at least 95{\%} of the earliest detectable endocytic vesicles arise from clathrin-coated pits. GPI-anchored proteins, candidate cargoes for alternate pathways, are also found to enter the cell predominantly via coated pits. Experiments employing a mutated clathrin adaptor reveal distinct mechanisms for sorting into coated pits, and thereby explain differential effects on the uptake of transferrin and GPI-anchored proteins. These data call for a revision of models for the activity and diversity of endocytic pathways in mammalian cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Zhang2017,
abstract = {Membrane fission is a fundamental process in cells, involved inter alia in endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and virus infection. Its underlying molecular mechanism, however, is only incompletely understood. Recently, experiments and computer simulation studies have revealed that dynamin-mediated membrane fission is a two-step process that proceeds via a metastable hemi-fission intermediate (or wormlike micelle) formed by dynamin's constriction. Importantly, this hemi-fission intermediate is remarkably metastable, i.e., its subsequent rupture that completes the fission process does not occur spontaneously but requires additional, external effects, e.g., dynamin's (unknown) conformational changes or membrane tension. Using simulations of a coarse-grained, implicit-solvent model of lipid membranes, we investigate the molecular mechanism of rupturing the hemi-fission intermediate, such as its pathway, the concomitant transition states, and barriers, as well as the role of membrane tension. The membrane...},

abstract = {Author Summary Cells use endocytosis to intake molecules and to recycle components of their membrane. Even in its simplest form, endocytosis involves a large number of proteins with often redundant functions that are organized into a microscopic force-producing “machine”. Knowing how much force is needed to induce a membrane invagination is essential to understand how this endocytic machine may operate. We show that experimental membrane shapes are well described theoretically by a thin sheet elastic model including a difference of pressure across the membrane due to turgor. This allows us to integrate the different contributions that shape the membrane, and to compute the forces opposing membrane deformation. This calculation provides an estimate of the pulling force that must be generated by the actin machinery in yeast. We also identify a membrane instability that could lead to vesicle budding.},

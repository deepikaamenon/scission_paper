abstract = {As a result of the genome sequencing project in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three open reading frames were found in the yeast genome that contain sequences with strong homology to all the domains conserved among the four mammalian phosphatidylinositol-phosphate 5-phosphatases: inpp5bp, ocrl1p, synaptojanin, and ship. In addition, all three yeast gene products shared with synaptojanin regions of homology to the SAC1 gene of yeast. Disruption of each of these genes singly and in pairs produced mutant strains that were viable but demonstrated variable phenotypes of abnormal vacuolar and plasma membrane morphology as well as increased sensitivity to osmotic stress. Total phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity was reduced to varying degrees in each of the strains. No defect in carboxypeptidase Y sorting was seen in a processing and targeting assay. Abnormal actin cytoskeleton morphology was present in some of the strains carrying mutations in two of the genes.},

abstract = {Fluorescence live-cell imaging has temporally resolved the conserved choreography of more than 30 proteins involved in clathrin and actin-mediated endocytic budding from the plasma membrane. However, the resolution of these studies is insufficient to unveil how the endocytic machinery actually drives membrane deformation in vivo. In this study, we use quantitative immuno-EM to introduce the temporal dimension to the ultrastructural analysis of membrane budding and define changes in the topography of the lipid bilayer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Using this approach, we frame the emergence of membrane curvature with respect to the recruitment of endocytic factors and show that constriction of the invaginations correlates with translocation of membrane-sculpting proteins. Furthermore, we show that initial bending of the plasma membrane is independent of actin and clathrin polymerization and precedes building of an actin cap branched by the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, our data indicate that constriction and additional elongation of the endocytic profiles require the mechanochemical activity of the myosins-I. Altogether, this work provides major insights into the molecular mechanisms driving membrane deformation in a cellular context.},

abstract = {F-BAR proteins are known to participate in cytokinesis, but their mechanisms are not well understood. Here we investigated Rga7p an S. pombe F-BAR protein with a RhoGAP domain. Localization of Rga7p to the cytokinetic cleavage furrow depends on its F-BAR domain, actin filaments, formins Cdc12p and For3p, and the presence of a contractile ring. Rga7p is not required for the constriction of the contractile ring but does participate in the transport of a $\beta$-glucan synthetase Bgs4p from the late Golgi compartments to the plasma membrane adjacent to the contractile ring. Cells without Rga7p moved Bgs4p normally from the poles to the Golgi apparatus near the cell center, but Bgs4p then moved slowly from the late Golgi compartments to the cleavage site. The late arrival and lower than normal numbers of Bgs4p result in septal defects late in cytokinesis and lysis of separating cells similar to cells with the mutations in the cwg1(+) gene encoding Bgs4p.},

abstract = {Members of the Mx protein family promote interferon-inducible resistance to viral infection in mammals and act by unknown mechanisms. We identified an Mx-like protein in yeast and present genetic evidence for its cellular function. This protein, the VPS1 product, is essential for vacuolar protein sorting, normal organization of intracellular membranes, and growth at high temperature, implying that Mx-like proteins are engaged in fundamental cellular processes in eukaryotes. Vps1p contains a tripartite GTP binding motif, which suggests that binding to GTP is essential to its role in protein sorting. Vps1p-specific antibody labels punctate cytoplasmic structures that condense to larger structures in a Golgi-accumulating sec7 mutant; thus, Vps1p may associate with an intermediate organelle of the secretory pathway.},

abstract = {Dynamin mediates various membrane fission events, including the scission of clathrin-coated vesicles. Here, we provide direct evidence for cooperative membrane recruitment of dynamin with the BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) proteins, endophilin and amphiphysin. Surprisingly, endophilin and amphiphysin recruitment to membranes was also dependent on binding to dynamin due to auto-inhibition of BAR-membrane interactions. Consistent with reciprocal recruitment in vitro, dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane in cells was strongly reduced by concomitant depletion of endophilin and amphiphysin, and conversely, depletion of dynamin dramatically reduced the recruitment of endophilin. In addition, amphiphysin depletion was observed to severely inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, GTP-dependent membrane scission by dynamin was dramatically elevated by BAR domain proteins. Thus, BAR domain proteins and dynamin act in synergy in membrane recruitment and GTP-dependent vesicle scission.},

@article{Hohmann2002,
abstract = {The ability to adapt to altered availability of free water is a fundamental property of living cells. The principles underlying osmoadaptation are well conserved. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model system with which to study the molecular biology and physiology of osmoadaptation. Upon a shift to high osmolarity, yeast cells rapidly stimulate a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which orchestrates part of the transcriptional response. The dynamic operation of the HOG pathway has been well studied, and similar osmosensing pathways exist in other eukaryotes. Protein kinase A, which seems to mediate a response to diverse stress conditions, is also involved in the transcriptional response program. Expression changes after a shift to high osmolarity aim at adjusting metabolism and the production of cellular protectants. Accumulation of the osmolyte glycerol, which is also controlled by altering transmembrane glycerol transport, is of central importance. Upon a shift from high to low osmolarity, yeast cells stimulate a different MAP kinase cascade, the cell integrity pathway. The transcriptional program upon hypo-osmotic shock seems to aim at adjusting cell surface properties. Rapid export of glycerol is an important event in adaptation to low osmolarity. Osmoadaptation, adjustment of cell surface properties, and the control of cell morphogenesis, growth, and proliferation are highly coordinated processes. The Skn7p response regulator may be involved in coordinating these events. An integrated understanding of osmoadaptation requires not only knowledge of the function of many uncharacterized genes but also further insight into the time line of events, their interdependence, their dynamics, and their spatial organization as well as the importance of subtle effects.},

abstract = {Branched and crosslinked actin networks mediate cellular processes that move and shape membranes. To understand the mechanisms of force-generation by actin, we used a hybrid imaging approach that combines live imaging with correlative microscopy to analyse deletion mutants of yeast actin network components. Our data show that the actin network needs to be physically linked to the plasma membrane to overcome a force threshold for initiating membrane bending. Two force-generating mechanisms reshape the membrane in successive phases. First, nucleation and polymerization of new actin filaments pull the membrane invagi- nation. Then, rearrangement and expansion of the actin network provide the driving force for vesicle formation and propulsion. The transition between the phases occurs 2 seconds before scission when the filament nucleation rate drops. Our findings suggest that actin-based motili- ty can be uncoupled from actin network growth and can be driven by the release of stress accumulated by the crosslinked actin network.},

abstract = {Back to TopAbstract
Correlative electron and fluorescence microscopy has the potential to elucidate the ultrastructural details of dynamic and rare cellular events, but has been limited by low precision and sensitivity. Here we present a method for direct mapping of signals originating from ∼20 fluorescent protein molecules to 3D electron tomograms with a precision of less than 100 nm. We demonstrate that this method can be used to identify individual HIV particles bound to mammalian cell surfaces. We also apply the method to image microtubule end structures bound to mal3p in fission yeast, and demonstrate that growing microtubule plus-ends are flared in vivo. We localize Rvs167 to endocytic sites in budding yeast, and show that scission takes place halfway through a 10-s time period during which amphiphysins are bound to the vesicle neck. This new technique opens the door for direct correlation of fluorescence and electron microscopy to visualize cellular processes at the ultrastructural scale.},

abstract = {In yeast, nutrient starvation leads to entry into stationary phase. Mutants that do not respond properly to starvation conditions have been isolated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among them the rvs161 mutant (RVS for Reduced Viability upon Starvation) is sensitive to carbon, nitrogen and sulphur starvation. When these nutrients are depleted in the medium, mutant cells show cellular viability loss with morphological changes. The mutation rvs161-1 is very pleiotropic, and besides the defects in stationary phase entry, the mutant strain presents other alterations: sensitivity to high salt concentrations, hypersensitivity to amino acid analogs, no growth on lactate or acetate medium. The addition of salts or amino acid analogs leads to the same morphological defects observed in starved cells, suggesting that the gene could be implicated mainly in the control of cellular viability. The gene RVS161 was cloned; it codes for a 30,252 daltons protein. No homology was detected with the proteins contained in the databases. Moreover, Southern analysis revealed the presence of other sequences homologous to the RVS161 gene in the yeast genome.},

abstract = {Functional characterization of the genes of higher eukaryotes has been aided by their expression in model organisms and by analyzing site-specific changes in homologous genes in model systems such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Modifying sequences in yeast or other organisms such that no heterologous material is retained requires in vitro mutagenesis together with subcloning. PCR-based procedures that do not involve cloning are inefficient or require multistep reactions that increase the risk of additional mutations. An alternative approach, demonstrated in yeast, relies on transformation with an oligonucleotide, but the method is restricted to the generation of mutants with a selectable phenotype. Oligonucleotides, when combined with gap repair, have also been used to modify plasmids in yeast; however, this approach is limited by restriction-site availability. We have developed a mutagenesis approach in yeast based on transformation by unpurified oligonucleotides that allows the rapid creation of site-specific DNA mutations in vivo. A two-step, cloning-free process, referred to as delitto perfetto, generates products having only the desired mutation, such as a single or multiple base change, an insertion, a small or a large deletion, or even random mutations. The system provides for multiple rounds of mutation in a window up to 200 base pairs. The process is RAD52 dependent, is not constrained by the distribution of naturally occurring restriction sites, and requires minimal DNA sequencing. Because yeast is commonly used for random and selective cloning of genomic DNA from higher eukaryotes such as yeast artificial chromosomes, the delitto perfetto strategy also provides an efficient way to create precise changes in mammalian or other DNA sequences.},

abstract = {Understanding the issue of specificity imposed in the interactions of SH3 domains has largely been addressed in studies investigating the interaction of proline-rich amino acid sequences derived from potential ligands for these domains. Although the interaction with this motif forms an essential platform in the binding of SH3 domains, in many cases little specificity is observed and the difference in affinity for so-called specific and nonspecific proline-rich sequences is not great. Furthermore, the binding interface between an SH3 domain and a protein ligand appears to encompass more interactions than are represented by that involving the proline-rich motif. Here we investigate the issue of specificity from the opposite point of view; namely, how does a ligand recognize different SH3 domains? We present the crystal structure of the unbound SH3 domain from hemopoietic cell kinase (Hck) which is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. This structure reveals that, unlike the structures of other Src kinase SH3 domains, the RT loop region is highly mobile and lacks a network of hydrogen bonds that is elsewhere apparent. The RT loop has been shown to form a major part of the binding interface between SH3 domains and HIV-1 Nef. Thermodynamic data, derived from isothermal titration calorimetry, for the binding of Hck SH3 to HIV-1 Nef show that the binding of Hck (KD = 1.5 microM) is approximately an order of magnitude tighter than those of other Src family kinases that were investigated (Fyn, Lck, and Src). This increase in affinity is attributed to, among other effects, the inherent flexibility in the RT loop which does not require breaking the network of hydrogen bonds to adopt the conformation required for binding.},

abstract = {The accumulation and transport of solutes are hallmarks of osmoadaptation. In this study we have employed the inability of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gpd1$\Delta$ gpd2$\Delta$ mutant both to produce glycerol and to adapt to high osmolarity to study solute transport through aquaglyceroporins and the control of osmostress-induced signaling. High levels of different polyols, including glycerol, inhibited growth of the gpd1$\Delta$ gpd2$\Delta$ mutant. This growth inhibition was suppressed by expression of the hyperactive allele Fps1-$\Delta$1 of the osmogated yeast aquaglyceroporin, Fps1. The degree of suppression correlated with the relative rate of transport of the different polyols tested. Transport studies in secretory vesicles confirmed that Fps1-$\Delta$1 transports polyols at increased rates compared with wild type Fps1. Importantly, wild type Fps1 and Fps1-$\Delta$1 showed similarly low permeability for water. The growth defect on polyols in the gpd1$\Delta$ gpd2$\Delta$ mutant was also suppressed by expression of a heterologous aquaglyceroporin, rat AQP9. We surmised that this suppression was due to polyol influx, causing the cells to passively adapt to the stress. Indeed, when aquaglyceroporin-expressing gpd1$\Delta$ gpd2$\Delta$ mutants were treated with glycerol, xylitol, or sorbitol, the osmosensing HOG pathway was activated, and the period of activation correlated with the apparent rate of polyol uptake. This observation supports the notion that deactivation of the HOG pathway is closely coupled to osmotic adaptation. Taken together, our “conditional” osmotic stress system facilitates studies on aquaglyceroporin function and reveals features of the osmosensing and signaling system.},

In addition, sequence comparisons revealed that amphiphysin, a protein first found in synaptic vesicles of chicken and shown to be the autoantigen of Stiff Man syndrome, presents similarity with both Rvs proteins. Furthermore, limited similarities with myosin heavy chain and tropomyosin alpha chain from higher eukaryotic cells allow for the definition of a possible consensus sequence. The finding of related sequences suggests the existence of a function for these proteins that is conserved among eukaryotic organisms.},

abstract = {The product of the VPS1 gene, Vps1p, is required for the sorting of soluble vacuolar proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We demonstrate here that Vps1p, which contains a consensus tripartite motif for guanine nucleotide binding, is capable of binding and hydrolyzing GTP. Vps1p is a member of a subfamily of large GTP-binding proteins whose members include the vertebrate Mx proteins, the yeast MGM1 protein, the Drosophila melanogaster shibire protein, and dynamin, a bovine brain protein that bundles microtubules in vitro. Disruption of microtubules did not affect the fidelity or kinetics of vacuolar protein sorting, indicating that Vps1p function is not dependent on microtubules. Based on mutational analyses, we propose a two-domain model for Vps1p function. When VPS1 was treated with hydroxylamine, half of all mutations isolated were found to be dominant negative with respect to vacuolar protein sorting. All of the dominant-negative mutations analyzed further mapped to the amino-terminal half of Vps1p and gave rise to full-length protein products. In contrast, recessive mutations gave rise to truncated or unstable protein products. Two large deletion mutations in VPS1 were created to further investigate Vps1p function. A mutant form of Vps1p lacking the carboxy-terminal half of the protein retained the capacity to bind GTP and did not interfere with sorting in a wild-type background. A mutant form of Vps1p lacking the entire GTP-binding domain interfered with vacuolar protein sorting in wild-type cells. We suggest that the amino-terminal domain of Vps1p provides a GTP-binding and hydrolyzing activity required for vacuolar protein sorting, and the carboxy-terminal domain mediates Vps1p association with an as yet unidentified component of the sorting apparatus.},

To determine the functional relationship between these proteins and dynamin, we have analyzed endocytic intermediates that accumulate in cells that lack dynamin (derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice). In these cells, actin-nucleating proteins, actin, and BAR domain proteins accumulate at the base of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where they support the growth of dynamic long tubular necks. These results, which we show reflect the sequence of events in wild-type cells, demonstrate a concerted action of these proteins prior to, and independent of, dynamin and emphasize similarities between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Our data also demonstrate that the relationship between dynamin and actin is intimately connected to dynamin's endocytic role and that dynamin terminates a powerful actin- and BAR protein-dependent tubulating activity.},

Surprisingly, endophilin and amphiphysin recruitment to membranes was also dependent on binding to dynamin due to auto-inhibition of BAR-membrane interactions. Consistent with reciprocal recruitment in vitro, dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane in cells was strongly reduced by concomitant depletion of endophilin and amphiphysin, and conversely, depletion of dynamin dramatically reduced the recruitment of endophilin. In addition, amphiphysin depletion was observed to severely inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, GTP-dependent membrane scission by dynamin was dramatically elevated by BAR domain proteins. Thus, BAR domain proteins and dynamin act in synergy in membrane recruitment and GTP-dependent vesicle scission.},

We show that endophilin localizes in the vesicle pool at rest and in spirals at the necks of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) during activity in lamprey synapses. Endophilin and dynamin colocalize at the base of the clathrin coat. Protein spirals composed of these proteins on lipid tubes in vitro have a pitch similar to the one observed at necks of CCPs in living synapses, and lipid tubules are thinner than those formed by dynamin alone. Tubulation efficiency and the amount of dynamin recruited to lipid tubes are dramatically increased in the presence of endophilin. Blocking the interactions of the endophilin SH3 domain in situ reduces dynamin accumulation at the neck and prevents the formation of elongated necks observed in the presence of GTP$\gamma$S. Therefore, endophilin recruits dynamin to a restricted part of the CCP neck, forming a complex, which promotes budding of new synaptic vesicles.},

abstract = {Summary
BAR proteins are involved in a variety of membrane remodeling events but how they can mold membranes into different shapes remains poorly understood. Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we find that vesicle binding of the N-BAR protein amphiphysin is predominantly mediated by the shallow insertion of amphipathic N-terminal helices. In contrast, the interaction with tubes involves deeply inserted N-terminal helices together with the concave surface of the BAR domain, which acts as a scaffold. Combined with the observed concentration dependence of tubulation and BAR domain scaffolding, the data indicate that initial membrane deformations and vesicle binding are mediated by insertion of amphipathic helical wedges, while tubulation requires high protein densities at which oligomeric BAR domain scaffolds form. In addition, we identify a pocket of residues on the concave surface of the BAR domain that insert deeply into tube membrane. Interestingly, this pocket harbors a number of disease mutants in the homologous amphiphysin 2.},

abstract = {SNX33 (sorting nexin 33) is a homologue of the endocytic protein SNX9 and has been implicated in actin polymerization and the endocytosis of the amyloid precursor protein. SNX33 belongs to the large family of BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain-containing proteins, which alter cellular protein trafficking by modulating cellular membranes and the cytoskeleton. Some BAR domains engage in homodimerization, whereas other BAR domains also mediate heterodimerization between different BAR domain-containing proteins. The molecular basis for this difference is not yet understood. Using co-immunoprecipitations we report that SNX33 forms homodimers, but not heterodimers, with other BAR domain-containing proteins, such as SNX9. Domain deletion analysis revealed that the BAR domain, but not the SH3 (Src homology 3) domain, was required for homodimerization of SNX33. Additionally, the BAR domain prevented the heterodimerization between SNX9 and SNX33, as determined by domain swap experiments. Molecular modelling of the SNX33 BAR domain structure revealed that key amino acids located at the BAR domain dimer interface of the SNX9 homodimer are not conserved in SNX33. Replacing these amino acids in SNX9 with the corresponding amino acids of SNX33 allowed the mutant SNX9 to heterodimerize with SNX33. Taken together, the present study identifies critical amino acids within the BAR domains of SNX9 and SNX33 as determinants for the specificity of BAR domain-mediated interactions and suggests that SNX9 and SNX33 have distinct molecular functions.},

abstract = {Cellular proteins containing Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domains play a key role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Despite extensive structural and functional studies of BAR domains, it is still unknown how exactly these domains interact with the plasma membrane containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) and whether they function by a universal mechanism or by different mechanisms. Here we report that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) specifically induces partial membrane penetration of the N-terminal amphiphilic $\alpha$-helix (H(0)) of two representative N-BAR domains from Drosophila amphiphysin (dAmp-BAR) and rat endophilin A1 (EndoA1-BAR). Our quantitative fluorescence imaging analysis shows that PtdIns(4,5)P(2)-dependent membrane penetration of H(0) is important for self-association of membrane-bound dAmp-BAR and EndoA1-BAR and their membrane deformation activity. EndoA1-BAR behaves differently from dAmp-BAR because the former has an additional amphiphilic $\alpha$-helix that penetrates the membrane in a PtdIns(4,5)P(2)-independent manner. Depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) from the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells abrogated the membrane deforming activity of EndoA1-BAR and dAmp-BAR. Collectively, these studies suggest that the local PtdIns(4,5)P(2) concentration in the plasma membrane may regulate the membrane interaction and deformation by N-BAR domain-containing proteins during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.},

Howald, and H. Riezman. 1986. Cell. 46:355-364). After internalization, alpha-factor is delivered to the vacuole via vesicular intermediates and degraded there consistent with an endocytic mechanism (Singer, B., and H. Riezman. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 110:1911-1922; Chvatchko, Y., I. Howald, and H. Riezman. 1986. Cell. 46:355-364). We have isolated two mutants that are defective in the internalization process. Both mutations confer a recessive, temperature-sensitive growth phenotype upon cells that cosegregates with their endocytosis defect. Lucifer yellow, a marker for fluid-phase endocytosis, shows accumulation characteristics in the mutants that are similar to the uptake characteristics of 35S-alpha-factor. The endocytic defect in end4 cells appears immediately upon shift to restrictive temperature and is reversible at permissive temperature if new protein synthesis is allowed. Furthermore, the end4 mutation only affects alpha-factor internalization and not the later delivery of alpha-factor to the vacuole. Other vesicle-mediated processes seem to be normal in end3 and end4 mutants. END3 and END4 are the first genes shown to be necessary for the internalization step of receptor-borne and fluid-phase markers in yeast.},

Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process. Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide powerful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites. In this review, we focus on progress made in elucidating the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis.},

abstract = {Cofilin is the major mediator of actin filament turnover in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of cofilin recruitment to actin networks during dynamic actin-mediated processes in living cells and cofilin's precise in vivo functions have not been determined. In this study, we analyzed the dynamics of fluorescently tagged cofilin and the role of cofilin-mediated actin turnover during endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In living cells, cofilin is not necessary for actin assembly on endocytic membranes but is recruited to molecularly aged adenosine diphosphate actin filaments and is necessary for their rapid disassembly. Defects in cofilin function alter the morphology of actin networks in vivo and reduce the rate of actin flux through actin networks. The consequences of decreasing actin flux are manifested by decreased but not blocked endocytic internalization at the plasma membrane and defects in late steps of membrane trafficking to the vacuole. These results suggest that cofilin-mediated actin filament flux is required for the multiple steps of endocytic trafficking.},

Previously, we used live-cell imaging of six budding-yeast proteins to define a pathway for association of receptors, adaptors, and actin during endocytic internalization. Here, we analyzed the effects of 61 deletion mutants on the dynamics of this pathway, revealing functions for 15 proteins, and we analyzed the dynamics of 8 of these proteins. Our studies provide evidence for four protein modules that cooperate to drive coat formation, membrane invagination, actin-meshwork assembly, and vesicle scission during clathrin/actin-mediated endocytosis. We found that clathrin facilitates the initiation of endocytic-site assembly but is not needed for membrane invagination or vesicle formation. Finally, we present evidence that the actin-meshwork assembly that drives membrane invagination is nucleated proximally to the plasma membrane, opposite to the orientation observed for previously studied actin-assembly-driven motility processes.

abstract = {Evolutionary cell biology can afford an interdisciplinary comparative view that gives insights into both the functioning of modern cells and the origins of cellular systems, including the endocytic organelles. Here, we explore several recent evolutionary cell biology studies, highlighting investigations into the origin and diversity of endocytic systems in eukaryotes. Beginning with a brief overview of the eukaryote tree of life, we show how understanding the endocytic machinery in a select, but diverse, array of organisms provides insights into endocytic system origins and predicts the likely configuration in the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA). Next, we consider three examples in which a comparative approach yielded insight into the function of modern cellular systems. First, using ESCRT-0 as an example, we show how comparative cell biology can discover both lineage-specific novelties (ESCRT-0) as well as previously ignored ancient proteins (Tom1), likely of both evolutionary and functional importance. Second, we highlight the power of comparative cell biology for discovery of previously ignored but potentially ancient complexes (AP5). Finally, using examples from ciliates and trypanosomes, we show that not all organisms possess canonical endocytic pathways, but instead likely evolved lineage-specific mechanisms. Drawing from these case studies, we conclude that a comparative approach is a powerful strategy for advancing knowledge about the general mechanisms and functions of endocytic systems.},

Here we show that ​BIN1/​M-Amphiphysin2, a protein involved in T-tubule biogenesis in muscle cells and frequently mutated in centronuclear myopathies, clusters PtdIns(4,5)P2 to recruit its downstream partner dynamin. By using several mutants associated with centronuclear myopathies, we find that the N-BAR and the SH3 domains of ​BIN1 control the kinetics and the accumulation of dynamin on membranes, respectively. We show that phosphoinositide clustering is a mechanism shared by other proteins that interact with PtdIns(4,5)P2, but do not contain a BAR domain. Our numerical simulations point out that clustering is a diffusion-driven process in which phosphoinositide molecules are not sequestered. We propose that this mechanism plays a key role in the recruitment of downstream phosphoinositide-binding proteins.},

We apply this "tethered ratchet" model to derive the force-velocity relation for Listeria and discuss relations of our theoretical predictions to experimental measurements.

The biophysical basis of the motility of L. monocytogenes is an interesting question in its own right, the answer to which may shed light on the general processes of actin-based motility in cells. Moving intracellular bacteria display phase-dense 'comet tails' made of actin filaments, the formation of which is required for bacterial motility2,3. We have investigated the dynamics of the actin filaments in the comet tails using the technique of photoactivation of fluorescence, which allows monitoring of the movement and turnover of labelled actin filaments after activation by illumination with ultraviolet light. We find that the actin filaments remain stationary in the cytoplasm as the bacterium moves forward, and that length of the comet tails is linearly proportional to the rate of movement. Our results imply that the motile mechanism involves continuous polymerization and release of actin filaments at the bacterial surface and that the rate of filament generation is related to the rate of movement. We suggest that actin polymerization provides the driving force for bacterial propulsion. {\textcopyright} 1992 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: WASp family proteins promote actin filament assembly by activating Arp2/3 complex and are regulated spatially and temporally to assemble specialized actin structures used in diverse cellular processes. Some WASp family members are autoinhibited until bound by activating ligands; however, regulation of the budding yeast WASp homolog (Las17/Bee1) has not yet been explored.
RESULTS: We isolated full-length Las17 and characterized its biochemical activities on yeast Arp2/3 complex. Purified Las17 was not autoinhibited; in this respect, it is more similar to SCAR/WAVE than to WASp proteins. Las17 was a much stronger activator of Arp2/3 complex than its carboxyl-terminal (WA) fragment. In addition, actin polymerization stimulated by Las17-Arp2/3 was much less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of profilin compared to polymerization stimulated by WA-Arp2/3. Two SH3 domain-containing binding partners of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, were purified and were shown to cooperate in inhibiting Las17 activity. The two SLA1 SH3 domains required for this inhibitory activity in vitro were also required in vivo, in combination with BBC1, for cell viability and normal actin organization.
CONCLUSIONS: Full-length Las17 is not autoinhibited and activates Arp2/3 complex more strongly than its WA domain alone, revealing an important role for the Las17 amino terminus in Arp2/3 complex activation. Two of the SH3 domain-containing ligands of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, cooperate to inhibit Las17 activity in vitro and are required for a shared function in actin organization in vivo. Our results show that, like SCAR/WAVE, WASp proteins can be controlled by negative regulation through the combined actions of multiple ligands.},

Results: Dynamin is recruited to membranes by BAR-­‐domain proteins, which in turn rely on interaction with dynamin to bind membranes . Conclusion : Membrane binding by dynamin and BAR - ­‐domain proteins is cooperative and stimulates dynamin and GTP dependent membrane scission. Significance : Indicates how membrane recruitment of endocytotic proteins is orchestrated and their activity regulated . Abstract Dynamin mediates various membrane fission events , including the scission of clathrin - ­‐coated vesicles . Here we provide direct evidence for cooperative membrane recruitment of dynamin with the BAR proteins , endophilin and amphiphysin . Surprisingly , endophilin and amphiphysin recruitment to membranes was also dependent on binding to dynamin due to auto - ­‐inhibition of BAR - ­‐membrane interactions . Consistent with reciprocal recruitment in vitro , dynamin recruitment to the plasma membrane in cells was strongly reduced by concomitant depletion of endophilin and amphiphysin , and conversely , depletion of dynamin dramatically reduced the recruitment of endophilin . In addition amphiphysin depletion was observed to severely inhibit clathrin - ­‐mediated endocytosis . Furthermore , GTP - ­‐dependent membrane scission by dynamin was dramatically elevated by BAR domain proteins . Thus BAR domain proteins and dynamin act in synergy in membrane recruitment and GTP - ­‐dependent vesicle scission .},

Mutations in the RVS genes lead to synthetic lethality with a set of mutations in the actin gene, ACT1. This synthetic lethality is allele-specific regarding the act1 mutations, pointing to a region on the actin molecule where contacts with the myosin head have been described. The possible involvement of a myosin in a vital function fulfilled both by the Rvsp proteins and actin is strengthened further by the fact that the double mutants rvs167, myo1 and rvs167, myo2 are lethal and severely affected in growth respectively. These data support the idea that actin, myosin and Rvsp proteins are linked in a common functional pathway in yeast.},

abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is a key pathway for transporting cargo into cells via membrane vesicles; it plays an integral role in nutrient import, signal transduction, neurotransmission, and cellular entry of pathogens and drug-carrying nanoparticles. Because CME entails substantial local remodeling of the plasma membrane, the presence of membrane tension offers resistance to bending and hence, vesicle formation. Experiments show that in such high-tension conditions, actin dynamics is required to carry out CME successfully. In this study, we build on these pioneering experimental studies to provide fundamental mechanistic insights into the roles of two key endocytic proteins—namely, actin and BAR proteins—in driving vesicle formation in high membrane tension environment. Our study reveals an actin force-induced “snap-through instability” that triggers a rapid shape transition from a shallow invagination to a highly invaginated tubular structure. We show that the association of BAR proteins stabilizes vesicles and induces a milder instability. In addition, we present a rather counterintuitive role of BAR depolymerization in regulating the shape evolution of vesicles. We show that the dissociation of BAR proteins, supported by actin–BAR synergy, leads to considerable elongation and squeezing of vesicles. Going beyond the membrane geometry, we put forth a stress-based perspective for the onset of vesicle scission and predict the shapes and composition of detached vesicles. We present the snap-through transition and the high in-plane stress as possible explanations for the intriguing direct transformation of broad and shallow invaginations into detached vesicles in BAR mutant yeast cells.},

abstract = {In order to compare the molecular principles of the acclimatization of bacterial cells to salt and nonionic osmotic stress, the moderately halotolerant cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was challenged by salt (NaCl), and the osmolytes sorbitol and maltose. The physiological response towards each of the three compounds was found to be different. After salt addition, the cell volume remained unchanged, and the accumulation of the osmoprotective compound glucosylglycerol (GG) was observed after activation of the key enzyme GgpS at the biochemical and gene (ggpS) expression level. Sorbitol addition had only minor effects on the cell volume. In spite of the fact that the ggpS expression was increased, the GgpS enzyme was not activated, resulting in the absence of GG accumulation. In contrast the cells accumulated sorbitol, which served as a compatible solute and assured a certain osmotic resistance. In comparison to NaCl and sorbitol, the addition of maltose caused a strong decrease in cell volume indicating water efflux. However, no osmolyte accumulation was observed, resulting in an osmosensitive phenotype. Consequently, a successful response of Synechocystis cells to an osmotic challenge is indicative of the de novo synthesis of GG upon salt-dependent activation of the GgpS enzyme or the uptake of external solutes.},

In order to understand the role that Cmd1p plays, a search was carried out for possible targets among the genes required for the internalization process. Co-immunoprecipitation, two-hybrid and overlay assays demonstrated that Cmd1p interacts with Myo5p, a type I unconventional myosin. Analysis of the endocytic phenotype and the Cmd1p-Myo5p interaction in thermosensitive cmd1 mutants indicated that the Cmd1p-Myo5p interaction is required for endocytosis in vivo. However, the Cmd1p-Myo5p interaction requirement was partially overcome by deleting the calmodulin binding sites (IQ motifs) from Myo5p, suggesting that these motifs inhibit Myo5p function. Additionally, genetic and biochemical evidence obtained with a collection of cmd1 mutant alleles strongly suggests that Cmd1p plays an additional role in the internalization step of receptor-mediated endocytosis in yeast.},

abstract = {The essential phospholipid PI4,5P2 is generated by a well conserved PI4P 5‐kinase, Mss4, in yeast. Balanced production and turnover of PI4,5P2 is important for normal organization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell viability. Previous studies have shown that multiple PI phosphatases can regulate PI4,5P2 levels. We report a new, unexpected regulatory mechanism for PI4,5P2 homeostasis, directed by nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling of the lipid kinase. We show that Mss4 is a phosphoprotein, which contains a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) and can shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Temperature‐conditional mss4 cells that accumulate Mss4 protein in the nucleus exhibit reduced levels of PI4,5P2, depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton and a block in Mss4 phosphorylation, suggesting an essential role for phosphorylated Mss4 at the plasma membrane. Through the isolation of gene dosage‐dependent suppressors of mss4 mutants, we identified Bcp1, a protein enriched in the nucleus, which is required for Mss4 nuclear export and is related to the mammalian BRCA2‐interacting protein BCCIP. Together, these studies suggest a new mechanism for lipid kinase regulation through regulated nuclear–cytoplasmic shuttling.},

@article{Morgan2013,
abstract = {Neurotransmission requires a continuously available pool of synaptic vesicles (SVs) that can fuse with the plasma membrane and release their neurotransmitter contents upon stimulation. After fusion, SV membranes and membrane proteins are retrieved from the presynaptic plasma membrane by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. After the internalization of a clathrin-coated vesicle, the vesicle must uncoat to replenish the pool of SVs. Clathrin-coated vesicle uncoating requires ATP and is mediated by the ubiquitous molecular chaperone Hsc70. In vitro, depolymerized clathrin forms a stable complex with Hsc70*ADP. This complex can be dissociated by nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs) that release ADP from Hsc70, allowing ATP to bind and induce disruption of the clathrin:Hsc70 association. Whether NEFs generally play similar roles in vesicle trafficking in vivo and whether they play such roles in SV endocytosis in particular is unknown. To address this question, we used information from recent structural and mechanistic studies of Hsp70:NEF and Hsp70:co-chaperone interactions to design a NEF inhibitor. Using acute perturbations at giant reticulospinal synapses of the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), we found that this NEF inhibitor inhibited SV endocytosis. When this inhibitor was mutated so that it could no longer bind and inhibit Hsp110 (a NEF that we find to be highly abundant in brain cytosol), its ability to inhibit SV endocytosis was eliminated. These observations indicate that the action of a NEF, most likely Hsp110, is normally required during SV trafficking to release clathrin from Hsc70 and make it available for additional rounds of endocytosis.},

Convergent evolution in both domains produces modular architectures that are composed of elaborate hierarchies of protocols and layers of feedback regulation, are driven by demand for robustness to uncertain environments, and use often imprecise components. This complexity may be largely hidden in idealized laboratory settings and in normal operation, becoming conspicuous only when contributing to rare cascading failures. These puzzling and paradoxical features are neither accidental nor artificial, but derive from a deep and necessary interplay between complexity and robustness, modularity, feedback, and fragility.

abstract = {The essential calmodulin genes in both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe were precisely replaced with genes encoding fusions between calmodulin and the green fluorescent protein (GFP). In living budding yeast the GFP-calmodulin fusion protein (GFP-Cmd1p) localized simultaneously to sites of cell growth and to the spindle pole body (SPB), the yeast analog of the centrosome. Having demonstrated proper localization of GFP-calmodulin in budding yeast, we examined the localization of a fusion between GFP and calmodulin (GFP-Camlp) in fission yeast, where calmodulin had not been localized by any method. We find GFP-Camlp also localizes both to sites of polarized cell growth and to the fission yeast SPB. The localization of calmodulin to the SPB by GFP fusion was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence. Antiserum to S. pombe calmodulin labeled the ends of the mitotic spindle stained with anti-tubulin antiserum. This pattern was identical to that seen using antiserum to Sad1p, a known SPB component. We then characterized the defects in a temperature-sensitive S. pombe calmodulin mutant. Mutant cam1-E14 cells synchronized in S phase completed DNA synthesis, but lost viability during transit of mitosis. Severe defects in chromosome segregation, including hypercondensation, fragmentation, and unequal allocation of chromosomal material were observed. Immunofluorescence analysis of tubulin revealed a population of cells containing either broken or mislocalized mitotic spindles, which were never observed in wild-type cells. Taken together with the subcellular localization of calmodulin, the observed spindle and chromosome segregation defects suggest that calmodulin performs an essential role during mitosis at the fission yeast SPB.},

Evidence for learning in non-neural multicellular organisms is scant, and only a few unequivocal reports of learning have been described in single-celled organisms. Here we demonstrate habituation, an unmistakable form of learning, in the non-neural organism Physarum polycephalum. In our experiment, using chemotaxis as the behavioural output and quinine or caffeine as the stimulus, we showed that P. polycephalum learnt to ignore quinine or caffeine when the stimuli were repeated, but responded again when the stimulus was withheld for a certain time. Our results meet the principle criteria that have been used to demonstrate habituation: responsiveness decline and spontaneous recovery. To distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation or motor fatigue, we also show stimulus specificity. Our results point to the diversity of organisms lacking neurons, which likely display a hitherto unrecognized capacity for learning, and suggest that slime moulds may be an ideal model system in which to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying learning processes. Besides, documenting learning in non-neural organisms such as slime moulds is centrally important to a comprehensive, phylogenetic understanding of when and where in the tree of life the earliest manifestations of learning evolved.},

Several investigators have postulated the existence of distinct pools of PIP2 within the cell to account for the myriad functions of this lipid. Recent experimental work indicates certain regions of the plasma membrane—membrane ruffles and nascent phagosomes—do indeed concentrate PIP2. We consider two mechanisms that could account for this phenomenon: local synthesis and electrostatic sequestration. We conclude by considering the hypothesis that proteins such as MARCKS bind a significant fraction of the PIP2 in a cell, helping to sequester it in lateral membrane domains, then release this lipid in response to local signals such as an increased concentration of Ca++/calmodulin or activation of protein kinase C.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

abstract = {In order to study the ultrastructure of the cell surface and plasma membrane of Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a function of growth conditions we investigated exponential and stationary phase cells grown in rich and minimal medium. Electron microscopic preparation techniques based on rapid cryofixation (without cryoprotectants) were used. The intramembraneous aspects of the plasma membrane were described by freeze fracturing. For the first time the dynamic surface structures could be directly analyzed by freeze drying in the scanning electron microscope and in thin section of freeze substituted samples. This preparation techniques reveal hair-like structures on the surface of yeast cells. The hairs of cells grown in the rich medium are longer than those grown in the minimal medium. A mutant defective in the structure of a cell surface galactomannoprotein (acid phosphatase) reveals (under conditions of maximal acid phosphatase expression) a cell surface structure that differs from the wild type. It is likely that the hairs represent the peripheral galactomannan layer or part of it. On the membrane fracture faces the number, shape, distribution and state of aggregation of the intramembraneous particles are different between membranes of growing and non-growing cells and between cells grown under different physiological conditions. In the minimal medium corresponding periodical structures on the plasmic and exoplasmic fracture faces were observed, which clearly differ between exponential and stationary phase cells. The number, length and depth of plasma membrane invaginations increase as the cells go from the exponential phase to the stationary phase. Short and flattened invaginations are filled with thin periodic structures.},

abstract = {Recycling of cellular membranes and their constituents plays a role for cell survival and growth. In the budding yeast, there are recycling traffics from early and late endosomal compartments to the late Golgi. Here, we examined a possible role for Vps1, a large GTPase, in the recycling traffic of GFP-Snc1 from early endosomes to the late Golgi. In the absence of Vps1 we observed an aberrant accumulation of GFP-Snc1 puncta in the cytoplasm that we identified as early endosomes. The N-terminal GTPase and the C-terminal GED domains of Vps1 are essential for Vps1's function in Snc1 recycling. Our finding of genetic interactions of VPS1 with genes involved in early endosome-to-Golgi traffic further suggests Vps1 functions as a recycling factor in the membrane traffic. Finally, we provide evidence that the severe accumulation of GFP-Snc1 cytoplasmic puncta in vps1$\Delta$ cells is attributed to a mild defect in the retention of the GARP component Vps51 at the late Golgi, as well as a severe disruption of actin cables.},

abstract = {Dual colour total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool for decoding the molecular dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Typically, the recruitment of a fluorescent protein-tagged endocytic protein was referenced to the disappearance of spot-like clathrin-coated structure (CCS), but the precision of spot-like CCS disappearance as a marker for canonical CME remained unknown. Here we have used an imaging assay based on total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to detect scission events with a resolution of ∼ 2 s. We found that scission events engulfed comparable amounts of transferrin receptor cargo at CCSs of different sizes and CCS did not always disappear following scission. We measured the recruitment dynamics of 34 types of endocytic protein to scission events: Abp1, ACK1, amphiphysin1, APPL1, Arp3, BIN1, CALM, CIP4, clathrin light chain (Clc), cofilin, coronin1B, cortactin, dynamin1/2, endophilin2, Eps15, Eps8, epsin2, FBP17, FCHo1/2, GAK, Hip1R, lifeAct, mu2 subunit of the AP2 complex, myosin1E, myosin6, NECAP, N-WASP, OCRL1, Rab5, SNX9, synaptojanin2$\beta$1, and syndapin2. For each protein we aligned ∼ 1,000 recruitment profiles to their respective scission events and constructed characteristic "recruitment signatures" that were grouped, as for yeast, to reveal the modular organization of mammalian CME. A detailed analysis revealed the unanticipated recruitment dynamics of SNX9, FBP17, and CIP4 and showed that the same set of proteins was recruited, in the same order, to scission events at CCSs of different sizes and lifetimes. Collectively these data reveal the fine-grained temporal structure of CME and suggest a simplified canonical model of mammalian CME in which the same core mechanism of CME, involving actin, operates at CCSs of diverse sizes and lifetimes.},

abstract = {SNARE proteins zipper to form complexes (SNAREpins) that power vesicle fusion with target membranes in a variety of biological processes. A single SNAREpin takes about 1 s to fuse two bilayers, yet a handful can ensure release of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles much faster: in a 10th of a millisecond. We propose that, similar to the case of muscle myosins, the ultrafast fusion results from cooperative action of many SNAREpins. The coupling originates from mechanical interactions induced by confining scaffolds. Each SNAREpin is known to have enough energy to overcome the fusion barrier of 25-[Formula: see text]; however, the fusion barrier only becomes relevant when the SNAREpins are nearly completely zippered, and from this state, each SNAREpin can deliver only a small fraction of this energy as mechanical work. Therefore, they have to act cooperatively, and we show that at least three of them are needed to ensure fusion in less than a millisecond. However, to reach the prefusion state collectively, starting from the experimentally observed half-zippered metastable state, the SNAREpins have to mechanically synchronize, which takes more time as the number of SNAREpins increases. Incorporating this somewhat counterintuitive idea in a simple coarse-grained model results in the prediction that there should be an optimum number of SNAREpins for submillisecond fusion: three to six over a wide range of parameters. Interestingly, in situ cryoelectron microscope tomography has very recently shown that exactly six SNAREpins participate in the fusion of each synaptic vesicle. This number is in the range predicted by our theory.},

We have previously shown that both actin-regulating kinase MoArk1 and adenylyl cyclase-associated protein MoCap1 regulate actin dynamics and endocytosis to play a key role in virulence of the fungus. To understand the underlying mechanism, we have characterized the actin-binding protein MoAbp1 that interacts with MoArk1 from M. oryzae. The $\Delta$Moabp1 mutant exhibited delayed endocytosis and defects in the growth, host penetration, and invasive growth. Consistent with its putative function associated with actin-binding, MoAbp1 regulates the localization of actin patches and plays a role in MoArk1 phosphorylation. In addition, MoAbp1 interacts with MoCap1 affecting its normal patch localization pattern and the actin protein MoAct1 through its conserved domains. Taken together, our results support a notion that MoAbp1 functions as a protein scaffold linking MoArk1, MoCap1 and MoAct1 to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics critical in growth and pathogenicity of the blast fungus.},

The tail of these proteins contains a Tail Homology 2 (TH2) domain that constitutes a putative actin-binding site. Because of the important mechanistic implications of a second ATP-independent actin-binding site, we analyzed its functional relevance in vivo. Even though the myosin tail interacts with actin, and this interaction seems functionally important, deletion of a major portion of the TH2 domain did not abolish interaction. In contrast, we found that the SH3 domain of Myo5p significantly contributes to this interaction, implicating other proteins. We found that Vrp1p, the yeast homolog of WIP [Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-interacting protein], seems necessary to sustain the Myo5p tail-F-actin interaction. Consistent with recent results implicating the yeast type I myosins in regulating actin polymerization in vivo, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of Myo5p is able to induce cytosol-dependent actin polymerization in vitro, and that this activity requires both an intact Myo5p SH3 domain and Vrp1p.},

Results: PtdIns(4,5)P 2 specifically induces membrane penetration and self-association of N-BAR domains. Conclusion: PtdIns(4,5)P 2 is an important regulator of the membrane deforming activity of N-BAR domains. Significance: This study provides new insight into how PtdIns(4,5)P 2 in the plasma membrane regulates the endocytic function of N-BAR domain proteins. Cellular proteins containing Bin/Amphiphysin/ Rvs (BAR) domains play a key role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Despite extensive structural and functional studies of BAR domains, it is still unknown how exactly these domains interact with the plasma membrane containing phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P 2) and whether they function by a universal mechanism or by different mechanisms. Here we report that PtdIns(4,5)P 2 specifically induces partial membrane penetration of the N-terminal amphiphilic $\alpha$-helix (H 0) of two representative N-BAR domains from Drosophila amphiphysin (dAmp-BAR) and rat endophilin A1 (EndoA1-BAR). Our quantitative fluorescence imaging analysis shows that PtdIns(4,5)P 2 -dependent membrane penetration of H 0 is important for self-association of membrane-bound dAmp-BAR and EndoA1-BAR and their membrane deformation activity. EndoA1-BAR behaves differently from dAmp-BAR because the former has an additional amphiphilic $\alpha$-helix that penetrates the membrane in a PtdIns(4,5)P 2 -independent manner. Depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P 2 from the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells abrogated the membrane deforming activity of EndoA1-BAR and dAmp-BAR. Collectively, these studies suggest that the local PtdIns(4,5)P 2 concentration in the plasma membrane may},

abstract = {Epitope tagging of proteins as a strategy for the analysis of function, interactions and the subcellular distribution of proteins has become widely used. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, molecular biological techniques have been developed that use a simple PCR-based strategy to introduce epitope tags to chromosomal loci (Wach et al., 1994). To further employ the power of this strategy, a variety of novel tags was constructed. These tags were combined with different selectable marker genes, resulting in PCR amplificable modules. Only one set of primers is required for the amplification of any module. Furthermore, convenient laboratory techniques are described that facilitate the genetic manipulations of yeast strains, as well as the analysis of the epitope-tagged proteins.

The structural features underlying this interaction are poorly understood. Using yeast as a model, we show that the Insert B domain of the Dnm1 guanosine triphosphatase (a DRP) contains a novel motif required for association with the mitochondrial adaptor Mdv1. Mutation of this conserved motif specifically disrupted Dnm1-Mdv1 interactions, blocking Dnm1 recruitment and mitochondrial fission. Suppressor mutations in Mdv1 that restored Dnm1-Mdv1 interactions and fission identified potential protein-binding interfaces on the Mdv1 $\beta$-propeller domain. These results define the first known function for Insert B in DRP-adaptor interactions. Based on the variability of Insert B sequences and adaptor proteins, we propose that Insert B domains and mitochondrial adaptors have coevolved to meet the unique requirements for mitochondrial fission of different organisms.},

abstract = {We used quantitative confocal microscopy to measure the numbers of 16 proteins tagged with fluorescent proteins during assembly and disassembly of endocytic actin patches in fission yeast. The peak numbers of each molecule that accumulate in patches varied {\textless}30-50{\%} between individual patches. The pathway begins with accumulation of 30-40 clathrin molecules, sufficient to build a hemisphere at the tip of a plasma membrane invagination. Thereafter precisely timed waves of proteins reach characteristic peak numbers: endocytic adaptor proteins (approximately 120 End4p and approximately 230 Pan1p), activators of Arp2/3 complex (approximately 200 Wsp1p and approximately 340 Myo1p) and approximately 300 Arp2/3 complexes just ahead of a burst of actin assembly into short, capped and highly cross-linked filaments (approximately 7000 actins, approximately 200 capping proteins, and approximately 900 fimbrins). Coronin arrives last as all other components disperse upon patch internalization and movement over approximately 10 s. Patch internalization occurs without recruitment of dynamins. Mathematical modeling, described in the accompanying paper (Berro et al., 2010, MBoC 21: 2803-2813), shows that the dendritic nucleation hypothesis can account for the time course of actin assembly into a branched network of several hundred filaments 100-200 nm long and that patch disassembly requires actin filament fragmentation in addition to depolymerization from the ends.},

abstract = {The ability to adapt to altered availability of free water is a fundamental property of living cells. The principles underlying osmoadaptation are well conserved. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an excellent model system with which to study the molecular biology and physiology of osmoadaptation. Upon a shift to high osmolarity, yeast cells rapidly stimulate a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade, the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which orchestrates part of the transcriptional response. The dynamic operation of the HOG pathway has been well studied, and similar osmosensing pathways exist in other eukaryotes. Protein kinase A, which seems to mediate a response to diverse stress conditions, is also involved in the transcriptional response program. Expression changes after a shift to high osmolarity aim at adjusting metabolism and the production of cellular protectants. Accumulation of the osmolyte glycerol, which is also controlled by altering transmembrane glycerol transport, is of central importance. Upon a shift from high to low osmolarity, yeast cells stimulate a different MAP kinase cascade, the cell integrity pathway. The transcriptional program upon hypo-osmotic shock seems to aim at adjusting cell surface properties. Rapid export of glycerol is an important event in adaptation to low osmolarity. Osmoadaptation, adjustment of cell surface properties, and the control of cell morphogenesis, growth, and proliferation are highly coordinated processes. The Skn7p response regulator may be involved in coordinating these events. An integrated understanding of osmoadaptation requires not only knowledge of the function of many uncharacterized genes but also further insight into the time line of events, their interdependence, their dynamics, and their spatial organization as well as the importance of subtle effects.},

In a systematic study of the sequential multicomponent actin assembly processes that accompany endocytosis in yeast, we examined and compared the roles of WASp, two type-I myosins, and two other Arp2/3 activators, along with that of coronin, which is a proposed inhibitor of Arp2/3. Quantitative analysis of high-speed fluorescence imaging revealed individual functions for the regulators, manifested in part by novel phenotypes. We conclude that Arp2/3 regulators have distinct and overlapping roles in the processes of actin assembly that drive endocytosis in yeast. The formation of the endocytic actin patch, the creation of the endocytic vesicle, and the movement of the vesicle into the cytoplasm display distinct dependencies on different Arp2/3 regulators. Knowledge of these roles provides insight into the in vivo relevance of the dendritic nucleation model for actin assembly.},

abstract = {During endocytosis, actin-dependent forces are needed to oppose internal turgor pressure for invagination of the plasma membrane. Live-cell imaging shows that addition of sorbitol to the medium significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process and rescues defects of endocytic mutants in fission yeast., Yeast and other walled cells possess high internal turgor pressure that allows them to grow and survive in the environment. This turgor pressure, however, may oppose the invagination of the plasma membrane needed for endocytosis. Here we study the effects of turgor pressure on endocytosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by time-lapse imaging of individual endocytic sites. Decreasing effective turgor pressure by addition of sorbitol to the media significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process before actin assembly and membrane ingression but does not affect the velocity or depth of ingression of the endocytic pit in wild-type cells. Sorbitol also rescues endocytic ingression defects of certain endocytic mutants and of cells treated with a low dose of the actin inhibitor latrunculin A. Endocytosis proceeds after removal of the cell wall, suggesting that the cell wall does not contribute mechanically to this process. These studies suggest that endocytosis is governed by a mechanical balance between local actin-dependent inward forces and opposing forces from high internal turgor pressure on the plasma membrane.},

These interactions are mediated by SH3 domains and are believed to play a regulatory role in synaptic vesicle recycling. We have precisely mapped the target peptides on human synaptojanin that are recognized by the SH3 domains of endophilins and amphiphysin and proven that they are distinct. By a combination of different approaches, selection of phage displayed peptide libraries, substitution analyses of peptides synthesized on cellulose membranes, and a peptide scan spanning a 252-residue long synaptojanin fragment, we have concluded that amphiphysin binds to two sites, PIRPSR and PTIPPR, whereas endophilin has a distinct preferred binding site, PKRPPPPR. The comparison of the results obtained by phage display and substitution analysis permitted the identification of proline and arginine at positions 4 and 6 in the PIRPSR and PTIPPR target sequence as the major determinants of the recognition specificity mediated by the SH3 domain of amphiphysin 1. More complex is the structural rationalization of the preferred endophilin ligands where SH3 binding cannot be easily interpreted in the framework of the "classical" type I or type II SH3 binding models. Our results suggest that the binding repertoire of SH3 domains may be more complex than originally predicted.},

Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) and Fer-CIP4 homology-BAR (F-BAR) proteins can induce membrane curvature and have been suggested to facilitate membrane invagination and scission. Two F-BAR proteins, Syp1 and Bzz1, are found at budding yeast endocytic sites. Syp1 arrives early but departs from the endocytic site before formation of deep membrane invaginations and scission. Using genetic, spatiotemporal, and ultrastructural analyses, we demonstrate that Bzz1, the heterodimeric BAR domain protein Rvs161/167, actin polymerization, and the lipid phosphatase Sjl2 cooperate, each through a distinct mechanism, to induce membrane scission in yeast. Additionally, actin assembly and Rvs161/167 cooperate to drive formation of deep invaginations. Finally, we find that Bzz1, acting at the invagination base, stabilizes endocytic sites and functions with Rvs161/167, localized along the tubule, to achieve proper endocytic membrane geometry necessary for efficient scission. Together, our results reveal that dynamic interplay between a lipid phosphatase, actin assembly, and membrane-sculpting proteins leads to proper membrane shaping, tubule stabilization, and scission.},

These suppressors also suppressed act1-1-related salt sensitivity and the defect in actin repolarization of the rvs161delta mutant, providing a link between sphingolipids and actin polarization. Indeed, deletion of the suppressor genes suppressed the rvs161delta defect in actin repolarization in two ways: either actin was not depolarized at the wild-type level in a set of suppressor mutants, or actin was repolarized in the absence of Rvs161p in the other suppressor mutants. Rvs161p was localized as cortical patches that concentrated at polarization sites, i.e., bud emergence and septa, and was found to be associated with lipid rafts. An important link between sphingolipids and actin polarization is that Rvs161p was required for actin repolarization and was found to be located in lipid rafts.},

Here we provide evidence that Sla1 and Rvs167 are orthologues of the mammalian CIN85 and endophilin proteins, respectively, which are required for ligand-stimulated growth factor receptor internalization. Sla1 is similar in domain structure to CIN85 and binds directly to the endophilin-like Rvs167. Akin to CIN85, Sla1 interacts with synaptojanins and a ubiquitin ligase that regulates endocytosis. This ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5, binds directly to both Sla1 and Rvs167. The interaction between Rsp5 and Rvs167 is mediated through Rsp5 WW domains and PXY motifs in the central Gly-Pro-Ala-rich domain of Rvs167. Rvs167 PXY motifs are required for Rsp5-dependent monoubiquitination of Rvs167 on Lys481 in the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. Mutation of Lys481 → Arg causes cells to grow slowly on medium containing 1 m NaCl, although this phenotype is not due to the defect in ubiquitination caused by the K481R mutation. We propose that Rsp5 interaction with Sla1-Rvs167 promotes Rvs167 ubiquitination and regulates activity of this protein complex. Rvs167 ubiquitination is not required for general function of Rvs167, but may control specific Rvs167 SH3 domain-protein interactions or negatively regulate SH3 domain activity.},

abstract = {Until recently, the actin cytoskeleton and the endocytic machinery were thought to operate independently. However, the actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex and there is growing evidence in diverse eukaryotes that F-actin plays a direct role during endocytic internalization. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have demonstrated that Arp2/3-mediated F-actin assembly is required specifically for the internalization step of endocytosis. Using real-time image analysis, we recently defined a pathway for receptor-mediated endocytosis in budding yeast. Many features of this pathway appear to be conserved widely, indicating that principles derived from our studies in yeast will be directly applicable in more complex eukaryotes. We are pursuing our yeast studies using a combined approach involving image analysis, functional genomics, proteomics and biochemistry. These ongoing studies are providing a broader and deeper understanding of the molecular events of endocytosis, of how forces for actin polymerization are harnessed, and of how steps in the pathway are regulated. Our studies in mammalian cells provide evidence that this pathway is conserved in more complex organisms for endocytic and Golgi trafficking events.},

This requirement can be relieved by inactivation of the cytosine 5'-diphosphate (CDP)-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis, indicating that Sec14p is an essential component of a regulatory pathway linking phospholipid metabolism with vesicle trafficking (the Sec14p pathway). Sac1p (refs 7 and 8) is an integral membrane protein related to inositol-5-phosphatases such as synaptojanin, a protein found in rat brain. Here we show that defects in Sac1p also relieve the requirement for Sec14p by altering phospholipid metabolism so as to expand the pool of diacylglycerol (DAG) in the Golgi. Moreover, although short-chain DAG improves secretory function in strains with a temperature-sensitive Sec14p, expression of diacylglycerol kinase from Escherichia coli further impairs it. The essential function of Sec14p may therefore be to maintain a sufficient pool of DAG in the Golgi to support the production of secretory vesicles.},

We show that amphiphysin resides in the synaptic vesicle cluster at rest and relocates to sites of endocytosis during synaptic activity. It accumulates at coated pits where its SH3 domain, but not its central clathrin/AP-2-binding (CLAP) region, is accessible for antibody binding. Microinjection of antibodies specifically directed against the CLAP region inhibited recycling of synaptic vesicles and caused accumulation of clathrin-coated intermediates with distorted morphology, including flat patches of coated presynaptic membrane. Our data provide evidence for an activity-dependent redistribution of amphiphysin in intact nerve terminals and show that amphiphysin is a component of presynaptic clathrin-coated intermediates formed during synaptic vesicle recycling.},

It is a substrate for cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 5, a member of the cyclin-dependent protein kinase family, which has been functionally linked to neuronal migration and neurite outgrowth via its action on the actin cytoskeleton. The yeast homologue of amphiphysin, Rvs167, functions in endocytosis and actin dynamics, is phosphorylated by the cdk5 homologue Pho85, and binds the Pho85 regulatory subunit Pcl2. We show here that amphiphysin 1 interacts with the cdk5-activating subunit p35 and that this interaction is mediated by the conserved NH2-terminal region of amphiphysin. Amphiphysin 1 colocalizes with p35 in the growth cones of neurons and at actin-rich peripheral lamellipodia in transfected fibroblasts. Amphiphysin is phosphorylated by cdk5 in a region including serines 272, 276, and 285. Amphiphysin 1 is also phosphorylated by the cdc2/cyclin B kinase complex in the same region and undergoes mitotic phosphorylation in dividing cells. These data indicate that phosphorylation by members of the cyclin-dependent kinase family is a conserved property of amphiphysin and suggest that this phosphorylation may play an important physiological role both in mitosis and in differentiated cells.},

abstract = {Using a structure–function analysis, we find that Rvs proteins are initially recruited to sites of endocytosis through their curvature-sensing and membrane-binding ability in a manner dependent on complex sphingolipids., BAR domains are protein modules that bind to membranes and promote membrane curvature. One type of BAR domain, the N-BAR domain, contains an additional N-terminal amphipathic helix, which contributes to membrane-binding and bending activities. The only known N-BAR-domain proteins in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Rvs161 and Rvs167, are required for endocytosis. We have explored the mechanism of N-BAR-domain function in the endocytosis process using a combined biochemical and genetic approach. We show that the purified Rvs161–Rvs167 complex binds to liposomes in a curvature-independent manner and promotes tubule formation in vitro. Consistent with the known role of BAR domain polymerization in membrane bending, we found that Rvs167 BAR domains interact with each other at cortical actin patches in vivo. To characterize N-BAR-domain function in endocytosis, we constructed yeast strains harboring changes in conserved residues in the Rvs161 and Rvs167 N-BAR domains. In vivo analysis of the rvs endocytosis mutants suggests that Rvs proteins are initially recruited to sites of endocytosis through their membrane-binding ability. We show that inappropriate regulation of complex sphingolipid and phosphoinositide levels in the membrane can impinge on Rvs function, highlighting the relationship between membrane components and N-BAR-domain proteins in vivo.},

abstract = {The synaptojanins represent a subfamily of inositol 5'-phosphatases that contain an NH2-terminal Sac1p homology domain. A nerve terminal-enriched synaptojanin, synaptojanin 1, was previously proposed to participate in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and actin function. The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains three synaptojanin-like genes (SJL1, SJL2 and SJL3), none of which is essential for growth. We report here that a yeast mutant lacking SJL1 and SJL2 (Deltasjl1 Deltasjl2) exhibits a severe defect in receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis. A less severe endocytic defect is present in a Deltasjl2 Deltasjl3 mutant, while endocytosis is normal in a Deltasjl1 Deltasjl3 mutant. None of the mutants are impaired in invertase secretion. The severity of the endocytic impairment of the sjl double mutants correlates with the severity of actin and polarity defects. Furthermore, the deletion of SJL1 suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect of sac6, a mutant in yeast fimbrin, supporting a role for synaptojanin family members in actin function. These findings provide a first direct evidence for a role of synaptojanin family members in endocytosis and provide further evidence for a close link between endocytosis and actin function.},

Endophilin lattices expose large areas of membrane surface and are held together by promiscuous interactions between endophilin's amphipathic N-terminal helices. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that endophilin lattices are highly dynamic and that the N-terminal helices are required for formation of a stable and regular scaffold. Furthermore, endophilin accommodates different curvatures through a quantized addition or removal of endophilin dimers, which in some cases causes dimerization of endophilin's SH3 domains, suggesting that the spatial presentation of SH3 domains, rather than affinity, governs the recruitment of downstream interaction partners.},

abstract = {APPL1 is an effector of the small GTPase Rab5. Together, they mediate a signal transduction pathway initiated by ligand binding to cell surface receptors. Interaction with Rab5 is confined to the amino (N)-terminal region of APPL1. We report the crystal structures of human APPL1 N-terminal BAR-PH domain motif. The BAR and PH domains, together with a novel linker helix, form an integrated, crescent-shaped, symmetrical dimer. This BAR-PH interaction is likely conserved in the class of BAR-PH containing proteins. Biochemical analyses indicate two independent Rab-binding sites located at the opposite ends of the dimer, where the PH domain directly interacts with Rab5 and Rab21. Besides structurally supporting the PH domain, the BAR domain also contributes to Rab binding through a small surface region in the vicinity of the PH domain. In stark contrast to the helix-dominated, Rab-binding domains previously reported, APPL1 PH domain employs beta-strands to interact with Rab5. On the Rab5 side, both switch regions are involved in the interaction. Thus we identified a new binding mode between PH domains and small GTPases.},

Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking the amphiphysin-like orthologs, Rvs161 or Rvs167, are unable to thrive under many stress conditions. Here we show cells lacking Rvs161 require Cdc55, the B subunit of the yeast ceramide-activated protein phosphatase, for viability under heat stress. By using specific rvs mutant alleles, we linked this lethal genetic interaction to loss of Rvs161 endocytic domain function. Recessive mutations in the sphingolipid pathway, such as deletion of the very long-chain fatty acid elongase, Sur4, suppress the osmotic growth defect of rvs161 cells. We demonstrate that Cdc55 is required for sur4-dependent suppressor activity and that protein phosphatase activation, through overexpression of CDC55 alone, can also remediate this defect. Loss of SUR4 in rvs161 cells reinitiates Ste3 a-factor receptor endocytosis and requires Cdc55 function to do so. Moreover, overexpression of CDC55 reinitiates Ste3 endocytic-dependent degradation and restores fluid phase endocytosis in rvs161 cells. In contrast, loss of SUR4 or CDC55 overexpression does not remediate the actin polarization defects of osmotic stressed rvs161 cells. Importantly, remediation of rvs161 defects by protein phosphatase activation requires the ceramide-activated protein phosphatase catalytic subunit, Sit4, and the protein phosphatase 2A catalytic subunits, Pph21/Pph22. Finally, genetic analyses reveal a synthetic lethal interaction between loss of CDC55 and gene deletions lethal with rvs161, all of which function in endocytosis.},

@article{Kay2000,
abstract = {Acommon focus among molecular and cellular biologists is the identification of proteins that interact with each other. Yeast two-hybrid, cDNA expression library screening, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments are powerful methods for identifying novel proteins that bind to one's favorite protein for the purpose of learning more regarding its cellular function. These same techniques, coupled with truncation and mutagenesis experiments, have been used to define the region of interaction between pairs of proteins. One conclusion from this work is that many interactions occur over short regions, often less than 10 amino acids in length within one protein. For example, mapping studies and 3-dimensional analyses of antigen-antibody interactions have revealed that epitopes are typically 4-7 residues long (1). Other examples include protein-interaction modules, such as Src homology (SH) 2 and 3 domains, phosphotyrosine binding domains (PTB), postsynaptic density/disc-large/ZO1 (PDZ) domains, WW domains, Eps15 homology (EH) domains, and 14-3-3 proteins that typically recognize linear regions of 3-9 amino acids. Each of these domains has been the subject of recent reviews published elsewhere (2 3 4 5 6 7). Among the primary structures of many ligands for protein-protein interactions, the amino acid proline is critical. In particular, SH3, WW, and several new protein-interaction domains prefer ligand sequences that are proline-rich. In addition, even though ligands for EH domains and 14-3-3 domains are not proline-rich, they do include a single proline residue. This review highlights the analysis of those protein-protein interactions that involve proline residues, the biochemistry of proline, and current drug discovery efforts based on proline peptidomimetics.-Kay, B.

However, these models are not mutually exclusive and subsequent studies have provided evidence for both dynamin functions. Here we present recent evidence derived from divergent in vivo and in vitro approaches that dynamin plays a dual role in CME, functioning at early stages as a fidelity monitor to regulate clathrin-coated pit maturation and at later stages to directly catalyze membrane fission and clathrin-coated vesicle formation.},

abstract = {The yeast dynamin Vps1 acts cooperatively with many proteins at diverse cellular locations for endocytosis, protein sorting, and membrane fusion and fission. It has been proposed that Vps1 is functionally linked to clathrin heavy chain 1 (Chc1), but the question of how, where, and when they function together remains unknown. Here we report that Vps1 arrives at the Golgi after clathrin, and that loss of Vps1 leads to a shift in the cellular localization of clathrin to the late endosome and vacuole, not vice versa. Our two-hybrid-based approach provides evidence that full-length Vps1 and its truncated versions bind to the C-terminal region of the Chc1. Cells lacking both Vps1 and Chc1 displayed more severe defects in carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) sorting at the Golgi than those in Vps1-deficient cells. Further, these Vps1 fragments became dominant-negative for CPY sorting upon overexpression. These results suggest that Vps1 binds to Chc1 and functions together at the Golgi for efficient Golgi-to-endosome membrane trafficking. In addition, we found that Vps1, without the aid of clathrin, plays a role in controlling the number and turnover of late Golgi.},

abstract = {Mechanical properties of fungal cells participate in the control of cell size, morphogenesis and function [-]. Tip growth can be understood by a viscoelastic model in which growth is derived by high internal turgor pressure and cell wall elasticity. To understand how these properties regulate growth in the rod-shaped fission yeast Schizosaccaromyces pombe, we measure key parameters by using femtoliter cylindrical PDMS microchambers with varying elasticity as force sensors for single cells. By buckling cells in these chambers, we determine the elastic surface modulus of the cell wall to be 20.2 ± 6.1 N.m-1. By analyzing the growth as they push against the walls of the chamber, we derive force-velocity relationships and values for internal effective turgor pressure of 0.85 ± 0.15 MPa and a growth stalling force of 11 ± 3 $\mu$N. The behavior of cells buckling under the force of their own growth provides an independent test of this model and parameters. Force generation is dependent on turgor pressure and a glycerol synthesis gene gpd1+ (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and is independent of actin cables. This study develops a quantitative framework for tip cell growth and characterize mechanisms of force generation that could contribute, for instance, in fungal invasion into host tissues.},

An essential function for the highly conserved N-terminal epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domain was revealed using deletions and randomly generated temperature-sensitive ent1 alleles. Changes in conserved ENTH domain residues in ent1(ts) cells revealed defects in endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton structure. The Ent1 protein was localized to peripheral and internal punctate structures, and biochemical fractionation studies found the protein associated with a large, Triton X-100-insoluble pellet. Finally, an Ent1p clathrin-binding domain was mapped to the final eight amino acids (RGYTLIDL*) in the Ent1 protein sequence. Based on these and other data, we propose that the yeast epsin-like proteins are essential components of an endocytic complex that may act at multiple stages in the endocytic pathway.},

In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics during endocytosis in yeast.

Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

The actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex, and there is growing evidence that F-actin plays a direct role in these endocytic events. Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process. Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide powerful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites. In this review, we focus on progress made in elucidating the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis.},

abstract = {Membrane fusion and fission are vital for eukaryotic life. For three decades, it has been proposed that fusion is mediated by fusion between the proximal leaflets of two bilayers (hemi-fusion) to produce a hemi-fused structure, followed by fusion between the distal leaflets, whereas fission is via hemi-fission, which also produces a hemi-fused structure, followed by full fission. This hypothesis remained unsupported owing to the lack of observation of hemi-fusion or hemi-fission in live cells. A competing fusion hypothesis involving protein-lined pore formation has also been proposed. Here we report the observation of a hemi-fused $\Omega$-shaped structure in live neuroendocrine chromaffin cells and pancreatic $\beta$-cells, visualized using confocal and super-resolution stimulated emission depletion microscopy. This structure is generated from fusion pore opening or closure (fission) at the plasma membrane. Unexpectedly, the transition to full fusion or fission is determined by competition between fusion and calcium/dynamin-dependent fission mechanisms, and is notably slow (seconds to tens of seconds) in a substantial fraction of the events. These results provide key missing evidence in support of the hemi-fusion and hemi-fission hypothesis in live cells, and reveal the hemi-fused intermediate as a key structure controlling fusion and fission, as fusion and fission mechanisms compete to determine the transition to fusion or fission.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Dynamin, which mediates membrane fission during endocytosis, binds endophilin and other members of the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) protein family. How endophilin influences endocytic membrane fission is still unclear. Here we show that dynamin-mediated membrane fission is potently inhibited in vitro when an excess of endophilin co-assembles with dynamin around membrane tubules. We further show by electron microscopy that endophilin intercalates between turns of the dynamin helix and impairs fission by preventing trans interactions between dynamin rungs that are thought to play critical roles in membrane constriction. In living cells, overexpression of endophilin delayed both fission and transferrin uptake. Together, our observations suggest that while endophilin helps shape endocytic tubules and recruit dynamin to endocytic sites, it can also block membrane fission when present in excess by inhibiting inter-dynamin interactions. The sequence of recruitment and the relative stoichiometry of the two proteins may be critical to regulated endocytic fission.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) involves the recruitment of numerous proteins to sites on the plasma membrane with prescribed timing to mediate specific stages of the process. However, how choreographed recruitment and function of specific proteins during CME is achieved remains unclear. Using genome editing to express fluorescent fusion proteins at native levels and live-cell imaging with single-molecule sensitivity, we explored dynamin2 stoichiometry, dynamics, and functional interdependency with actin. Our quantitative analyses revealed heterogeneity in the timing of the early phase of CME, with transient recruitment of 2-4 molecules of dynamin2. In contrast, considerable regularity characterized the final 20 s of CME, during which ∼26 molecules of dynamin2, sufficient to make one ring around the vesicle neck, were typically recruited. Actin assembly generally preceded dynamin2 recruitment during the late phases of CME, and promoted dynamin recruitment. Collectively, our results demonstrate precise temporal and quantitative regulation of the dynamin2 recruitment influenced by actin polymerization.},

abstract = {Fluorescence live-cell imaging has temporally resolved the conserved choreography of more than 30 proteins involved in clathrin and actin-mediated endocytic budding from the plasma membrane. However, the resolution of these studies is insufficient to unveil how the endocytic machinery actually drives membrane deformation in vivo. In this study, we use quantitative immuno-EM to introduce the temporal dimension to the ultrastructural analysis of membrane budding and define changes in the topography of the lipid bilayer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Using this approach, we frame the emergence of membrane curvature with respect to the recruitment of endocytic factors and show that constriction of the invaginations correlates with translocation of membrane-sculpting proteins. Furthermore, we show that initial bending of the plasma membrane is independent of actin and clathrin polymerization and precedes building of an actin cap branched by the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, our data indicate that constriction and additional elongation of the endocytic profiles require the mechanochemical activity of the myosins-I. Altogether, this work provides major insights into the molecular mechanisms driving membrane deformation in a cellular context.},

abstract = {The ease of construction of multiple mutant strains in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is limited by the number of available genetic markers. We describe here three new cassettes for PCR-mediated gene disruption that can be used in combination with commonly used fission yeast markers to make multiple gene deletions. The natMX6, hphMX6 and bleMX6 markers give rise to resistance towards the antibiotics nourseothricin (NAT), hygromycin B and phleomycin, respectively. The cassettes are composed of exogenous sequences to increase the frequency of integration at targeted loci, and have a structure similar to the commonly used pFA6a–kanMX6 modular plasmid system. This allows a simple exchange of the kanMX6 marker in existing strains with any of the three new cassettes. Alternatively, oligonucleotide primers designed for the modular kanMX6 cassettes can be used to make the transforming PCR fragments for gene disruption. We illustrate the construction of a mutant strain with six independent gene disruptions, using the novel antibiotic cassettes in combination with existing genetic markers.

Despite extensive research, the speed and mechanisms of synaptic vesicle endocytosis have remained controversial. Here, we establish low-noise time-resolved membrane capacitance measurements that allow monitoring changes in surface membrane area elicited by single action potentials and stronger stimuli with high-temporal resolution at physiological temperature in individual bona-fide mature central synapses. We show that single action potentials trigger very rapid endocytosis, retrieving presynaptic membrane with a time constant of 470 ms. This fast endocytosis is independent of clathrin but mediated by dynamin and actin. In contrast, stronger stimuli evoke a slower mode of endocytosis that is clathrin, dynamin, and actin dependent. Furthermore, the speed of endocytosis is highly temperature dependent with a Q10 of ∼3.5. These results demonstrate that distinct molecular modes of endocytosis with markedly different kinetics operate at central synapses.},

abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that the function of the large GTPase dynamin in endocytosis in mammalian cells may comprise a modulation of actin cytoskeleton. The role of dynamin in actin cytoskeleton organization in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has remained undefined. In this report, we found that one of the yeast dynamin-related proteins, Vps1p, is required for normal actin cytoskeleton organization. At both permissive and non-permissive temperatures, the vps1 mutants exhibited various degrees of phenotypes commonly associated with actin cytoskeleton defects: depolarized and aggregated actin structures, hypersensitivity to the actin cytoskeleton toxin latrunculin-A, randomized bud site selection and chitin deposition, and impaired efficiency in the internalization of membrane receptors. Over-expression of the GTPase mutants of vps1 also led to actin abnormalities. Consistent with these actin-related defects, Vps1p was found to interact physically, and partially co-localize, with the actin-regulatory protein Sla1p. The normal cellular localization of Sla1p required Vps1p and could be altered by over-expression of a region of Vps1p that was involved in the interaction with Sla1p. The same region also promoted mis-sorting of the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y upon over-expression. These findings suggest that the functions of the dynamin-related protein Vps1p in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and vacuolar protein sorting are probably related to each other.},

Here, we describe a role of the dynamin-like GTPase Vps1p in fusion of yeast vacuoles. Vps1p forms polymers that couple several t-SNAREs together. At the onset of fusion, the SNARE-activating ATPase Sec18p/NSF and the t-SNARE depolymerize Vps1p and release it from the membrane. This activity is independent of the SNARE coactivator Sec17p/alpha-SNAP and of the v-SNARE. Vps1p release liberates the t-SNAREs for initiating fusion and at the same time disrupts fission activity. We propose that reciprocal control between fusion and fission components exists, which may prevent futile cycles of fission and fusion.},

Perhaps the most widely useful of these are the heterologous dominant drug resistance cassettes, which use antibiotic resistance genes from bacteria and fungi as selectable markers. We have created three new dominant drug resistance cassettes by replacing the kanamycin resistance (kanr) open reading frame from the kanMX3 and kanMX4 disruption-deletion cassettes (Wach et al., 1994) with open reading frames conferring resistance to the antibiotics hygromycin B (hph), nourseothricin (nat) and bialaphos (pat). The new cassettes, pAG25 (natMX4), pAG29 (patMX4), pAG31 (patMX3), pAG32 (hphMX4), pAG34 (hphMX3) and pAG35 (natMX3), are cloned into pFA6, and so are in all other respects identical to pFA6–kanMX3 and pFA6–kanMX4. Most tools and techniques used with the kanMX plasmids can also be used with the hph, nat and patMX containing plasmids. These new heterologous dominant drug resistance cassettes have unique antibiotic resistance phenotypes and do not affect growth when inserted into the ho locus. These attributes make the cassettes ideally suited for creating S. cerevisiae strains with multiple mutations within a single strain. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1999 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Rvs167 and Rvs161 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae are amphiphysin family proteins, which are involved in several important cellular events, such as invagination and scission of endocytic vesicles, and actin cytoskeleton organization. It has been reported that cellular dysfunctions caused by deletion of RVS167 or RVS161 are rescued by deletion of specific nonessential sphingolipid-metabolizing enzyme genes. Here, we found that yeast cells lacking RVS167 or RVS161 exhibit a decrease in sphingolipid levels. In rvs167∆ cells, the expression level of Orm2, a negative regulator of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) catalyzing the initial step of sphingolipid biosynthesis, was increased in a calcineurin-dependent manner, and the decrease in sphingolipid levels in rvs167∆ cells was reversed on deletion of ORM2. Moreover, repression of both ORM1 and ORM2 expression or overexpression of SPT caused a strong growth defect of rvs167∆ cells, indicating that enhancement of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis is detrimental to rvs167∆ cells. In contrast, partial repression of LCB1-encoding SPT suppressed abnormal phenotypes caused by the deletion of RVS167, including supersensitivity to high temperature and salt stress, and impairment of endocytosis and actin cytoskeleton organization. In addition, the partial repression of SPT activity suppressed the temperature supersensitivity and abnormal vacuolar morphology caused by deletion of VPS1 encoding a dynamin-like GTPase, which is required for vesicle scission and is functionally closely related to Rvs167/Rvs161, whereas repression of both ORM1 and ORM2 expression in vps1∆ cells caused a growth defect. Thus, it was suggested that proper regulation of SPT activity is indispensable for amphiphysin-deficient cells.},

Membrane curvature induc-tion and stabilization are encoded within the BAR or Fer-CIP4 homology-BAR (F-BAR) domains, $\alpha$-helical coiled coils that dimerize into membrane-binding modules. BAR/F-BAR domain proteins often contain an SH3 domain, which recruits binding partners such as the oligomeric membrane-fissioning GTPase dynamin. How precisely BAR/F-BAR domain-mediated membrane deformation is regulated at the cellular level is unknown. Here we present the crystal structures of full-length syndapin 1 and its F-BAR domain. Our data show that syndapin 1 F-BAR-mediated membrane deformation is subject to autoinhibition by its SH3 domain. Release from the clamped confor-mation is driven by association of syndapin 1 SH3 with the proline-rich domain of dynamin 1, thereby unlocking its potent membrane-bending activity. We hypothesize that this mechanism might be com-monly used to regulate BAR/F-BAR domain-induced membrane defor-mation and to potentially couple this process to dynamin-mediated fission. Our data thus suggest a structure-based model for SH3-medi-ated regulation of BAR/F-BAR domain function. dynamin | endocytosis | membrane bending | syndapin E ukaryotic cells are characterized by a diverse array of mem-branous structures including vesicles, tubules, and pleiomorphic vacuoles that enable cellular processes such as organelle biogenesis, cell division, cell migration, secretion, and endocytosis. In most cases, dynamic membrane remodeling is accomplished by the reversible assembly of membrane-deforming proteins (1, 2), most notably by members of the Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain superfamily (3). BAR domains are characterized by $\alpha$-helical coiled coils that dimerize into modules with a positively charged surface that interacts with phospholipid membranes (4, 5). Self-assembly of BAR domain proteins, often in combination with the presence of amphipathic helices (6, 7), may then induce or stabilize membrane curvature de novo. Frequently, BAR domain proteins, such as syndapin, sorting nexin 9 (8), endophilin, and amphiphysin (9), also contain an SH3 domain that serves as an interaction platform for proline-rich motif-containing proteins including the large mem-brane-fissioning GTPase dynamin (10), suggesting that membrane bending is intimately linked with GTP-hydrolysis-dependent vesicle or tubule fission (9, 11, 12). How precisely membrane deformation by BAR domain proteins is regulated at the cellular level and how this may be coupled to fission are largely unknown. Syndapins [also termed pacsins (13)] are synaptically enriched proteins of the Fer-CIP4 homology-BAR (F-BAR) subfamily of BAR domain proteins that via their SH3 domain bind to dynamin (14) and to actin regulatory proteins such as N-WASP (15) and cordon bleu (COBL) (16). The F-BAR and SH3 domains of syn-dapins are connected via a flexible linker containing NPF motifs that interact with EH domain proteins, most notably EHD1 (3, 13, 15). Knockdown of syndapin 1 causes impaired axon development and branching and leads to defects in bulk endocytosis of synaptic vesicle (SV) membranes under intense stimulation in primary neurons (17). Similar effects are observed upon perturbation of syndapin function in lamprey reticulospinal axons (18). The role of syndapin in SV recycling appears to be under tight regulatory control by stimulation-induced dephosphorylation of dynamin 1 in nerve terminals (14). Similar regulatory mechanisms must operate to control the membrane-deforming activities of other BAR domain proteins (19–21) and the consumption of membrane buds and tubules by dynamin-mediated fission (9, 12, 17). Here we show by combined structural, biochemical, and cell bio-logical analysis that syndapin 1 F-BAR-mediated membrane bend-ing is subject to autoinhibition by its SH3 domain. Release from this clamped conformation is driven by association of syndapin 1 SH3 with dynamin 1 or of a proline-rich dynamin 1-derived peptide, thereby unlocking its potent membrane-deforming activity. These data thus suggest a model for SH3-mediated regulation of BAR/F-BAR domain function.},

abstract = {Background
Actin polymerization by Arp2/3 complex must be tightly regulated to promote endocytosis. While many Arp2/3 complex activators have been identified, mechanisms for its negative regulation have remained more elusive. We analyzed the yeast arp2-7 allele, which is biochemically unique in causing unregulated actin assembly in vitro in the absence of Arp2/3 activators.

Results
We examined endocytosis in arp2-7 mutants by live cell imaging of Sla1-GFP, a coat marker, and Abp1-RFP, which marks the later actin phase of endocytosis. Sla1-GFP and Abp1-RFP lifetimes were accelerated in arp2-7 mutants, which is opposite to actin nucleation-impaired arp2 alleles or deletions of Arp2/3 activators. We performed a screen for multi-copy suppressors of arp2-7 and identified SYP1, a FCHO1 homologue, which contains F-BAR and AP-2$\mu$ homology domains. Over-expression of SYP1 in arp2-7 cells slowed Sla1-GFP lifetimes closer to wild type cells. Further, purified Syp1 directly inhibited Las17/WASp stimulation of Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin assembly. This activity was mapped to a fragment of Syp1 located between its F-BAR and AP-2$\mu$ homology domains, and depends on non-VCA sequences in Las17/WASp.

Conclusions
Together, these data identify Syp1 as a novel negative regulator of WASp-Arp2/3 complex that helps choreograph the precise timing of actin assembly during endocytosis.},

To address the level of dynamic turnover needed for such processes, however, drugs or mutants that confer stabilising properties on F-actin are needed. Jasplakinolide is the only readily available drug that stabilises F-actin structures both in vivo and in vitro [3], [4], [5] and [6]. Yeast strains have been generated in which two of the ABC multidrug resistance transporter genes have been deleted, rendering normally jasplakinolide-resistant yeast cells sensitive to its effects. Treatment of these cells with jasplakinolide caused rapid and dramatic effects on the actin cytoskeleton, resulting in the accumulation of single large actin structures in cells. These structures, however, still contained components that are normally associated with cortical actin patches. A dynamic actin cytoskeleton was found to be critical for the generation of cell polarity and endocytosis.},

Here, we investigated possible roles for candidate disassembly factors in regulation of the dynamics of the endocytic coat proteins Sla2p, Ent1p, Ent2p, Sla1p, Pan1p and End3p, each of which has mammalian homologues. Live cell imaging analysis revealed that in addition to the synaptojanin, Sjl2p, the Ark1p and Prk1p protein kinases, the putative Arf GTPase-activating protein, Gts1p and the Arf GTPase-interacting protein, Lsb5p, also arrive at endocytic sites late in the internalization pathway, consistent with roles in coat disassembly. Analysis of coat dynamics in various mutant backgrounds revealed that multiple pathways, including the ones mediated by an Arf guanosine triphosphatase and a synaptojanin, facilitate efficient disassembly of different endocytic coat proteins. In total, at least four separate processes are important for disassembly of endocytic complexes and efficient downstream trafficking of endocytic cargo.},

abstract = {BAR domains are highly conserved protein domains participating in a diversity of cellular processes that involve membrane remodeling. The mechanisms underlying such remodeling are debated. For the relatively well-studied case of amphiphysin N-BAR domain, one suggested mechanism involves scaffolding, i.e., binding of a negatively charged membrane to the protein's positively charged curved surface. An alternative mechanism suggests that insertion of the protein's N-terminal amphipathic segments (N-helices H0) into the membrane leads to bending. Here, we address the issue through all-atom and coarse-grained simulations of multiple amphiphysin N-BAR domains and their components interacting with a membrane. We observe that complete N-BAR domains and BAR domains without H0s bend the membrane, but H0s alone do not, which suggests that scaffolding, rather than helix insertion, plays a key role in membrane sculpting by amphiphysin N-BAR domains.},

abstract = {Acommon focus among molecular and cellular biologists is the identification of proteins that interact with each other. Yeast two-hybrid, cDNA expression library screening, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments are powerful methods for identifying novel proteins that bind to one's favorite protein for the purpose of learning more regarding its cellular function. These same techniques, coupled with truncation and mutagenesis experiments, have been used to define the region of interaction between pairs of proteins. One conclusion from this work is that many interactions occur over short regions, often less than 10 amino acids in length within one protein. For example, mapping studies and 3-dimensional analyses of antigen-antibody interactions have revealed that epitopes are typically 4-7 residues long (1). Other examples include protein-interaction modules, such as Src homology (SH) 2 and 3 domains, phosphotyrosine binding domains (PTB), postsynaptic density/disc-large/ZO1 (PDZ) domains, WW domains, Eps15 homology (EH) domains, and 14-3-3 proteins that typically recognize linear regions of 3-9 amino acids. Each of these domains has been the subject of recent reviews published elsewhere (2 3 4 5 6 7). Among the primary structures of many ligands for protein-protein interactions, the amino acid proline is critical. In particular, SH3, WW, and several new protein-interaction domains prefer ligand sequences that are proline-rich. In addition, even though ligands for EH domains and 14-3-3 domains are not proline-rich, they do include a single proline residue. This review highlights the analysis of those protein-protein interactions that involve proline residues, the biochemistry of proline, and current drug discovery efforts based on proline peptidomimetics.-Kay, B.

In the absence of synaptojanin or endophilin, the membrane is rapidly invaginated, but pits do not become constricted at the base. The 5-phosphatase activity of synaptojanin is involved in formation of the neck, but 4-phosphatase is not required. Nevertheless, these pits are eventually cleaved into vesicles; within a 30-s interval, synaptic endosomes form and are resolved by clathrin-mediated budding. Then synaptojanin and endophilin function at a second step to aid with the removal of clathrin coats from the regenerated vesicles. These data together suggest that synaptojanin and endophilin can mediate membrane remodeling on a millisecond timescale during ultrafast endocytosis.},

abstract = {Capping protein (CP), which caps the growing ends of actin filaments, accelerates actin-based motility. Recent experiments on biomimetic beads have shown that CP also enhances the rate of actin filament nucleation. Proposed explanations for these phenomena include (i) the actin funneling hypothesis (AFH), in which the presence of CP increases the free-actin concentration, and (ii) the monomer gating model, in which CP binding to actin filament barbed ends makes more monomers available for filament nucleation. To establish how CP increases the rates of filament elongation and nucleation on biomimetic beads, we perform a quantitative modeling analysis of actin polymerization, using rate equations that include actin filament nucleation, polymerization and capping, as modified by monomer depletion near the surface of the bead. With one adjustable parameter, our simulation results match previously measured time courses of polymerized actin and filament number. The results support a version of the AFH where CP increases the local actin monomer concentration at the bead surface, but leaves the global free-actin concentration nearly constant. Because the rate of filament nucleation increases with the monomer concentration, the increased local monomer concentration enhances actin filament nucleation. We derive a closed-form formula for the characteristic CP concentration where the local free-actin concentration reaches half the bulk value, and find it to be comparable to the global Arp2/3 complex concentration. We also propose an experimental protocol for distinguishing branching nucleation of filaments from spontaneous nucleation.},

In addition, cells lacking the actin-binding protein, Sac6p, which is the yeast fimbrin homologue, are defective for internalization of alpha-factor suggesting that actin filament bundling might be required for this step. The actin dependence of endocytosis shows some interesting similarities to endocytosis from the apical membrane in polarized mammalian cells.},

abstract = {Background: WASp family proteins promote actin filament assembly by activating Arp2/3 complex and are regulated spatially and temporally to assemble specialized actin structures used in diverse cellular processes. Some WASp family members are autoinhibited until bound by activating ligands; however, regulation of the budding yeast WASp homolog (Las17/Bee1) has not yet been explored.
Results: We isolated full-length Las17 and characterized its biochemical activities on yeast Arp2/3 complex. Purified Las17 was not autoinhibited; in this respect, it is more similar to SCAR/WAVE than to WASp proteins. Las17 was a much stronger activator of Arp2/3 complex than its carboxyl-terminal (WA) fragment. In addition, actin polymerization stimulated by Las17-Arp2/3 was much less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of profilin compared to polymerization stimulated by WA-Arp2/3. Two SH3 domain-containing binding partners of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, were purified and were shown to cooperate in inhibiting Las17 activity. The two SLA1 SH3 domains required for this inhibitory activity in vitro were also required in vivo, in combination with BBC1, for cell viability and normal actin organization.
Conclusions: Full-length Las17 is not autoinhibited and activates Arp2/3 complex more strongly than its WA domain alone, revealing an important role for the Las17 amino terminus in Arp2/3 complex activation. Two of the SH3 domain-containing ligands of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, cooperate to inhibit Las17 activity in vitro and are required for a shared function in actin organization in vivo. Our results show that, like SCAR/WAVE, WASp proteins can be controlled by negative regulation through the combined actions of multiple ligands.},

Unexpectedly, mice lacking dynamin 1 were able to form functional synapses, even though their postnatal viability was limited. However, during spontaneous network activity, branched, tubular plasma membrane invaginations accumulated, capped by clathrin-coated pits, in synapses of dynamin 1-knockout mice. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis was severely impaired during strong exogenous stimulation but resumed efficiently when the stimulus was terminated.

Using electron and fluorescence microscopy, as well as biochemical assays, we show that the amount of actin dedicated to endocytosis is limiting at the apical surface of epithelia. In part, this contributes to the low basal rate of clathrin-dependent endocytosis observed at this epithelial surface. ARF6 in its GTP-bound state triggers the recruitment of actin from the cell cortex to the clathrin-coated pit to enable dynamin-dependent endocytosis. In addition, we show that perturbation of the apical endocytic system by expression of a clathrin heavy-chain mutant results in the collapse of microvilli. This phenotype was completely reversed by the expression of an ARF6-GTP-locked mutant. These observations indicate that concomitant to actin recruitment, the apical clathrin endocytic system is deeply involved in the morphology of the apical plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Author Summary
Electron microscopy (EM) once revolutionized cell biology by revealing subcellular anatomy at resolutions of tens of nanometers, well below the diffraction limit of light microscopy. Over the past two decades, light microscopy has been revitalized by the development of spontaneously fluorescent proteins, which allow nearly any protein of interest to be specifically tagged by genetic fusion. EM has lacked comparable genetic tags that are generally applicable. Here, we introduce “miniSOG”, a small (106-residue) fluorescent flavoprotein that efficiently generates singlet oxygen when illuminated by blue light. In fixed tissue, photogenerated singlet oxygen locally polymerizes diaminobenzidine into a precipitate that is stainable with osmium and therefore can be readily imaged at high resolution by EM. Thus miniSOG is a versatile label for correlated light and electron microscopy of genetically tagged proteins in cells, tissues, and organisms including intact nematodes and mice. As a demonstration of miniSOG's capabilities, controversies about the localization of synaptic cell adhesion molecules are resolved by EM of miniSOG fusions in neuronal culture and intact mouse brain.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

While crystal structures of different BAR dimers advanced our understanding of membrane shaping by scaffolding and hydrophobic insertion mechanisms considerably, especially life‐imaging techniques and loss‐of‐function studies of clathrin‐mediated endocytosis with its gradually increasing curvature show that the initial idea that solely BAR domain curvatures determine their functions is oversimplified. Diagonal placing, lateral lipid‐binding modes, additional lipid‐binding modules, tilde shapes and formation of macromolecular lattices with different modes of organisation and arrangement increase versatility. A picture emerges, in which BAR domain proteins create macromolecular platforms, that recruit and connect different binding partners and ensure the connection and coordination of the different events during the endocytic process, such as membrane invagination, coat formation, actin nucleation, vesicle size control, fission, detachment and uncoating, in time and space, and may thereby offer mechanistic explanations for how coordination, directionality and effectiveness of a complex process with several steps and key players can be achieved.},

abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton is a fundamental component of eukaryotic cells, with both structural and motile roles. Actin and many of the actin-binding proteins found in different cell types are highly conserved, showing considerable similarity in both primary structure and biochemical properties. To make detailed comparisons between homologous proteins, it is necessary to know whether the various proteins are functionally, as well as structurally, conserved. Fimbrin is an example of a cytoskeletal component that, as shown by sequence determinations and biochemical characterizations, is conserved between organisms as diverse as Saccharomyces cerevisiae and humans. In this study, we examined whether the human homolog can substitute for the yeast protein in vivo. We report here that two isoforms of human fimbrin, also referred to as T- and L-plastin, can both substitute in vivo for yeast fimbrin, also known as Sac6p, whereas a third isoform, I-fimbrin (or I-plastin), cannot. We demonstrate that the human T- and L-fimbrins, in addition to complementing the temperature-sensitive growth defect of the sac6 null mutant, restore both normal cytoskeletal organization and cell shape to the mutant cells. In addition, we show that human T- and L-fimbrins can complement a sporulation defect caused by the sac6 null mutation. These findings indicate that there is a high degree of functional conservation in the cytoskeleton, even between organisms as diverse as S. cerevisiae and humans.},

abstract = {Phosphoinositides (PI) are synthesized and turned over by specific kinases, phosphatases, and lipases that ensure the proper localization of discrete PI isoforms at distinct membranes. We analyzed the role of the yeast synaptojanin-like proteins using a strain that expressed only a temperature-conditional allele of SJL2. Our analysis demonstrated that inactivation of the yeast synaptojanins leads to increased cellular levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), accompanied by defects in actin organization, endocytosis, and clathrin-mediated sorting between the Golgi and endosomes. The phenotypes observed in synaptojanin-deficient cells correlated with accumulation of PtdIns(4,5)P2, because these effects were rescued by mutations in MSS4 or a mutant form of Sjl2p that harbors only PI 5-phosphatase activity. We utilized green fluorescent protein-pleckstrin homology domain chimeras (termed FLAREs for fluorescent lipid-associated reporters) with distinct PI-binding specificities to visualize pools of PtdIns(4,5)P2 and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in yeast. PtdIns(4,5)P2 localized to the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on Mss4p activity. On inactivation of the yeast synaptojanins, PtdIns(4,5)P2 accumulated in intracellular compartments, as well as the cell surface. In contrast, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate generated by Pik1p localized in intracellular compartments. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the yeast synaptojanins control the localization of PtdIns(4,5)P2 in vivo and provide further evidence for the compartmentalization of different PI species.},

abstract = {Hyperosmotic stresses represent one of the major constraints that adversely affect plants growth, development, and productivity. In this study, the focus was on early responses to hyperosmotic stress- (NaCl and sorbitol) induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt) increase, ion fluxes, and mitochondrial potential variations, and on their links in pathways leading to programmed cell death (PCD). By using BY-2 tobacco cells, it was shown that both NaCl- and sorbitol-induced PCD seemed to be dependent on superoxide anion (O2{\textperiodcentered}–) generation by NADPH-oxidase. In the case of NaCl, an early influx of sodium through non-selective cation channels participates in the development of PCD through mitochondrial dysfunction and NADPH-oxidase-dependent O2{\textperiodcentered}– generation. This supports the hypothesis of different pathways in NaCl- and sorbitol-induced cell death. Surprisingly, other shared early responses, such as [Ca2+]cyt increase and singlet oxygen production, do not seem to be involved in PCD.},

abstract = {DNA molecules that integrate into yeast chromosomes during yeast transformation do so by homologous recombination. We have studied the way in which circular and linear molecules recombine with homologous chromosomal sequences. We show that DNA ends are highly recombinogenic and interact directly with homologous sequences. Circular hybrid plasmids can integrate by a single reciprocal crossover, but only at a low frequency. Restriction enzyme digestion within a region homologous to yeast chromosomal DNA greatly enhances the efficiency of integration. Furthermore, if two restriction cuts are made within the same homologous sequence, thereby removing an internal segment of DNA, the resulting deleted-linear molecules are still able to transform at a high frequency. Surprisingly, the integration of these gapped-linear molecules results in replacement of the missing segment using chromosomal information. The final structure is identical to that obtained from integration of a circular molecule. The integration of linear and gapped-linear molecules, but not of circular molecules, is blocked by the rad52-1 mutation. Consideration of models for plasmid integration and gene conversion suggests that RAD52 may be involved in the DNA repair synthesis required for these processes. Implications of this work for the isolation of integrative transformants, fine-structure mapping, and the cloning of mutations are discussed.},

@article{Routhier2003,
abstract = {BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) adapter proteins have been suggested to regulate endocytosis, actin organization, apoptosis, and transcription, but their precise roles are obscure. There are at least five mammalian genes that encode BAR adapter proteins, including the evolutionarily conserved and ubiquitously expressed Bin1/Amphiphysin-II and Bin3 genes. Bin1 holds special interest as certain splice isoforms localize to the nucleus, interact with the c-Abl and c-Myc oncoproteins, and display tumor suppressor properties. To obtain functional insights, we embarked upon a genetic analysis of the two BAR adapter proteins expressed in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. In a previous work, a role in actin organization and cytokinesis was identified for the Bin3 homolog hob3+. In this study, a role in stress signaling was defined for the Bin1 homolog, hob1+. Notably, hob1+ was dispensable for endocytosis, actin organization, or osmotic sensitivity. Instead, mutation of hob1+ led to slight cell elongation and faulty cell cycle arrest upon nutrient starvation. These defects were complemented by Bin1, but not by Amphiphysin-I, arguing that these genes have distinct functions despite their structural similarity. hob1 delta mutant cells were also hypersensitive to genotoxic stress. This was not related to a faulty checkpoint response, but mutation in the checkpoint gene rad3(+) further exacerbated the sensitivity of hob1 delta mutant cells. Interestingly, mutation of the cell cycle regulator wee1+ partially relieved the sensitivity defect, suggesting that hob1+ may influence the efficiency of DNA repair or checkpoint release after DNA damage. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicated that hob3+ is epistatic to hob1+ in the response to genotoxic stress. Our findings indicate that the Bin1 homolog hob1+ participates in DNA damage signaling and they suggest a novel role for BAR adapter proteins in stress response processes.},

abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae synaptojanin-like proteins (Sjl1, Sjl2, and Sjl3) are phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatases that regulate PI metabolism in the control of actin organization and membrane trafficking. However, the primary sites of action for each of the yeast synaptojanin-like proteins remain unclear. In this study, we show that Sjl2 is localized to cortical actin patches, sites of endocytosis. Cortical recruitment of Sjl2 requires the actin patch component Abp1. Consistent with this, the SH3 domain-containing protein Abp1 physically associates with Sjl2 through its proline-rich domain. Furthermore, abp1$\Delta$ mutations confer defects resembling loss of SJL2; sjl1$\Delta$ abp1$\Delta$ double-mutant cells exhibit invaginated plasma membranes and impaired endocytosis, findings similar to those for sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant cells. Thus, Abp1 acts as an adaptor protein in the localization or concentration of Sjl2 during late stages of endocytic vesicle formation. Overexpression of the Hip1-related protein Sla2 delayed the formation of extended plasma membrane invaginations in sjl2ts cells, indicating that Sla2 may become limiting or misregulated in cells with impaired PI phosphatase activity. Consistent with this, the cortical actin patch protein Sla2 is mislocalized in sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant cells. Together, our studies suggest that PI metabolism by the synaptojanin-like proteins coordinately directs actin dynamics and membrane invagination, in part by regulation of Sla2.},

However, endocytosis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is completely dependent on a functional actin cytoskeleton, while actin appears to be less critical in mammalian cell endocytosis. We reveal that the fundamental requirement for actin in early stages of yeast endocytosis is to provide a strong framework to support force generation required to direct the invaginating plasma membrane into the cell against turgor pressure. By providing osmotic support, pressure differences across the plasma membrane were removed and this reduced the requirement for actin-bundling proteins required for normal endocytosis. Conversely, increased turgor pressure in specific yeast mutants correlated with decreased rate of endocytic patch invagination.},

The results showed that the amplitude of normalized evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in endophilin1 knockdown neurons decreased significantly for both single train and multiple train stimulations. Similar results were found using endophilin2 knockdown neurons, whereas endophilin3 siRNA exhibited no change compared with control neurons. Endophilin1 and endophilin2 affected SV endocytosis, but the effect of endophilin1 and endophilin2 double knockdown was not different from that of either knockdown alone. This result suggested that endophilin1 and endophilin2 functioned together but not independently during SV endocytosis.

We report here that exogenous oligonucleotides can efficiently target for repair a single DSB induced in a chromosome of yeast. The efficiency of recombinational targeting leading to a desired DNA change can be as high as 20{\%} of cells. The DSB was generated either by a regulatable I-SceI endonuclease just before transformation or appeared spontaneously at the site of a long inverted repeat composed of human Alu sequences. The approach used features of our previously described delitto perfetto system for selecting transformants with integrative recombinant oligonucleotides. The DSB repair mediated by pairs of complementary integrative recombinant oligonucleotides was efficient for targeting to homologous sequences that were close to or distant from the DSB and in the presence of a competing homologous chromosome in diploid cells. We also demonstrate that a DSB can strongly stimulate recombination with single-stranded DNA, without strand bias. These findings expand current models of DSB repair. In addition, we establish a high-throughput system for rapid genome-wide modification with oligonucleotides.},

abstract = {The membrane bending and GTPase-binding functions of proteins from the BAR-domain family, BAR-domains recently took centre stage in science through a report on the crystal structure of this domain in Drosophila Amphiphysin. Though only weakly conserved at the sequence level, the structure of the BAR domain shows striking similarity to the GTPase-binding domain of Arfaptin 2, an effector of Rho- and Arf- GTPases. On the basis of this sequence and structural similarity, these two proteins have been classified as belonging to the same family, the BAR-domain family, and they probably also have similar functional characteristics. Presented here are the results of a database search for the sequence of the BAR domain of Amphiphysin and Arfaptin 2. This search identified a variety of related proteins, most of which are involved in intracellular transport and especially in endocytosis. For example, the BAR-domain family includes Endophilins, GTPase-activating proteins of the Centaurin$\beta$ family and Oligophrenins, the adaptor proteins APPL1 and APPL2 that were recently shown to interact with the small GTPase Rab5, as well as members of the Sorting nexin family. On the basis of the structures of Amphiphysin and Arfaptin 2 and the cellular role of Amphiphysins in the early steps of endocytosis, the functions of the BAR domain have been defined as a dimerization motif and as sensing and inducing membrane curvature. However, data on Arfaptin 2 and now also on the Adaptor proteins APPL1 and 2 suggest that another function of the BAR domain is to bind to small GTPases.},

abstract = {In order to study the ultrastructure of the cell surface and plasma membrane of Schizosaccharomyces pombe as a function of growth conditions we investigated exponential and stationary phase cells grown in rich and minimal medium. Electron microscopic preparation techniques based on rapid cryofixation (without cryoprotectants) were used. The intramembraneous aspects of the plasma membrane were described by freeze fracturing. For the first time the dynamic surface structures could be directly analyzed by freeze drying in the scanning electron microscope and in thin section of freeze substituted samples. This preparation techniques reveal hair-like structures on the surface of yeast cells. The hairs of cells grown in the rich medium are longer than those grown in the minimal medium. A mutant defective in the structure of a cell surface galactomannoprotein (acid phosphatase) reveals (under conditions of maximal acid phosphatase expression) a cell surface structure that differs from the wild type. It is likely that the hairs represent the peripheral galactomannan layer or part of it. On the membrane fracture faces the number, shape, distribution and state of aggregation of the intramembraneous particles are different between membranes of growing and non-growing cells and between cells grown under different physiological conditions. In the minimal medium corresponding periodical structures on the plasmic and exoplasmic fracture faces were observed, which clearly differ between exponential and stationary phase cells. The number, length and depth of plasma membrane invaginations increase as the cells go from the exponential phase to the stationary phase. Short and flattened invaginations are filled with thin periodic structures.},

abstract = {Fluorescence live-cell imaging has temporally resolved the conserved choreography of more than 30 proteins involved in clathrin and actin-mediated endocytic budding from the plasma membrane. However, the resolution of these studies is insufficient to unveil how the endocytic machinery actually drives membrane deformation in vivo. In this study, we use quantitative immuno-EM to introduce the temporal dimension to the ultrastructural analysis of membrane budding and define changes in the topography of the lipid bilayer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Using this approach, we frame the emergence of membrane curvature with respect to the recruitment of endocytic factors and show that constriction of the invaginations correlates with translocation of membrane-sculpting proteins. Furthermore, we show that initial bending of the plasma membrane is independent of actin and clathrin polymerization and precedes building of an actin cap branched by the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, our data indicate that constriction and additional elongation of the endocytic profiles require the mechanochemical activity of the myosins-I. Altogether, this work provides major insights into the molecular mechanisms driving membrane deformation in a cellular context.},

@article{Yarmola2000,
abstract = {Latrunculin A is used extensively as an agent to sequester monomeric actin in living cells. We hypothesize that additional activities of latrunculin A may be important for its biological activity. Our data are consistent with the formation of a 1:1 stoichiometric complex with an equilibrium dissociation constant of 0.2 to 0.4 $\mu$m and provide no evidence that the actin-latrunculin A complex participates in the elongation of actin filaments. Profilin and latrunculin A bind independently to actin, whereas binding of thymosin $\beta$4 to actin is inhibited by latrunculin A. Potential implications of this differential effect on actin-binding proteins are discussed. From a structural perspective, if latrunculin A binds to actin at a site that sterically influences binding by thymosin $\beta$4, then the observation that latrunculin A inhibits nucleotide exchange on actin implies an allosteric effect on the nucleotide binding cleft. Alternatively, if, as previously postulated, latrunculin A binds in the nucleotide cleft of actin, then its ability to inhibit binding by thymosin $\beta$4 is a surprising result that suggests that significant allosteric changes affect the thymosin $\beta$4 binding site. We show that latrunculin A and actin form a crystalline structure with orthorhombic space group P212121and diffraction to 3.10 {\AA}. A high resolution structure with optimized crystallization conditions should provide insight regarding these remarkable allosteric properties.},

abstract = {The Candida albicans plasma membrane plays critical roles in growth and virulence and as a target for antifungal drugs. Three C. albicans genes that encode Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs homology domain proteins were mutated to define their roles in plasma membrane function. The deletion of RVS161 and RVS167, but not RVS162, caused strong defects. The rvs161$\Delta$ mutant was more defective in endocytosis and morphogenesis than rvs167$\Delta$, but both were strongly defective in polarizing actin patches. Other plasma membrane constituents were still properly localized, including a filipin-stained domain at the hyphal tips. An analysis of growth under different in vitro conditions showed that the rvs161$\Delta$ and rvs167$\Delta$ mutants grew less invasively in agar and also suggested that they have defects in cell wall synthesis and Rim101 pathway signaling. These mutants were also more resistant to the antimicrobial peptide histatin 5 but showed essentially normal responses to the drugs caspofungin and amphotericin. Surprisingly, the rvs161$\Delta$ mutant was more sensitive to fluconazole, whereas the rvs167$\Delta$ mutant was more resistant, indicating that these mutations cause overlapping but distinct effects on cells. The rvs161$\Delta$ and rvs167$\Delta$ mutants both showed greatly reduced virulence in mice. However, the mutants were capable of growing to high levels in kidneys. Histological analyses of infected kidneys revealed that these rvs$\Delta$ mutants grew in a large fungal mass that was walled off by leukocytes, rather than forming disseminated microabscesses as seen for the wild type. The diminished virulence is likely due to a combination of the morphogenesis defects that reduce invasive growth and altered cell wall construction that exposes proinflammatory components to the host immune system.},

abstract = {Endocytosis, the process whereby the plasma membrane invaginates to form vesicles, is essential for bringing many substances into the cell and for membrane turnover. The mechanism driving clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) involves {\textgreater} 50 different protein components assembling at a single location on the plasma membrane in a temporally ordered and hierarchal pathway. These proteins perform precisely choreographed steps that promote receptor recognition and clustering, membrane remodeling, and force-generating actin-filament assembly and turnover to drive membrane invagination and vesicle scission. Many critical aspects of the CME mechanism are conserved from yeast to mammals and were first elucidated in yeast, demonstrating that it is a powerful system for studying endocytosis. In this review, we describe our current mechanistic understanding of each step in the process of yeast CME, and the essential roles played by actin polymerization at these sites, while providing a historical perspective of how the landscape has changed since the preceding version of the YeastBook was published 17 years ago (1997). Finally, we discuss the key unresolved issues and where future studies might be headed.},

Over two decades ago the Genetics Perspectives editors solicited a perspective on my participation in the studies that deciphered the mechanism of mating-type switching and revealed the phenomenon of gene silencing in yeast. Although flattered at the time, I thought that preparation of such an article called for a more seasoned researcher who had benefitted from seeing his contributions stand the test of time. Now realizing that our discovery of the transposition of a mutation from the HM$\alpha$ locus into the MAT (mating type) locus has provided the genetic evidence that established the gene transposition model, and having witnessed our conclusions confirmed by subsequent molecular studies, I decided that perhaps this is a good time to recount the chronology of events as they unfolded for me decades ago.},

abstract = {The eisosome protein Pil1 interacts with the PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase Inp51, thereby recruiting it to the plasma membrane. Pil1 is essential for membrane localization of Inp51 but not for the homologous PI(4,5)P2 phosphatases Inp52 and Inp53. Consistent with this, Pil1 plays a crucial role in maintaining normal PI(4,5)P2 levels at the plasma membrane., The plasma membrane delineates the cell and mediates its communication and material exchange with the environment. Many processes of the plasma membrane occur through interactions of proteins with phosphatidylinositol(4,5)-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), which is highly enriched in this membrane and is a key determinant of its identity. Eisosomes function in lateral organization of the plasma membrane, but the molecular function of their major protein subunits, the BAR domain–containing proteins Pil1 and Lsp1, is poorly understood. Here we show that eisosomes interact with the PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase Inp51/Sjl1, thereby recruiting it to the plasma membrane. Pil1 is essential for plasma membrane localization and function of Inp51 but not for the homologous phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate phosphatases Inp52/Sjl2 and Inp53/Sjl3. Consistent with this, absence of Pil1 increases total and available PI(4,5)P2 levels at the plasma membrane. On the basis of these findings, we propose a model in which the eisosomes function in maintaining PI(4,5)P2 levels by Inp51/Sjl1 recruitment.},

abstract = {Dynamin, a crucial factor in endocytosis, is a member of a family of GTPases that participates in membrane fission. It was initially proposed to act as a machine that constricts and cuts the neck of nascent vesicles in a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent reaction, but subsequent studies suggested alternative models. Here we monitored the effect of nucleotides on dynamin-coated lipid tubules in real time. Addition of GTP, but not of GDP or GTP-$\gamma$S, resulted in twisting of the tubules and supercoiling, suggesting a rotatory movement of the helix turns relative to each other during GTP hydrolysis. Rotation was confirmed by the movement of beads attached to the tubules. Twisting activity produced a longitudinal tension that was released by tubule breakage when both ends of the tubule were anchored. Fission also occurred when dynamin and GTP were added to lipid tubules that had been generated from liposomes by the motor activity of kinesin on microtubules. No fission events were observed in the absence of longitudinal tension. These findings demonstrate a mechanoenzyme activity of dynamin in endocytosis, but also imply that constriction is not sufficient for fission. At the short necks of endocytic vesicles, other factors leading to tension may cooperate with the constricting activity of dynamin to induce fission.},

abstract = {To explore the conservation of Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-mediated networks in evolution, we compared the specificity landscape of these domains among four yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ashbya gossypii, Candida albicans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, encompassing 400 million years of evolution. We first aligned and catalogued the families of SH3-containing proteins in these four species to determine the relationships between homologous domains. Then, we tagged and purified all soluble SH3 domains (82 in total) to perform a quantitative peptide assay (SPOT) for each SH3 domain. All SPOT readouts were hierarchically clustered and we observed that the organization of the SH3 specificity landscape in three distinct profile classes remains conserved across these four yeast species. We also produced a specificity profile for each SH3 domain from manually aligned top SPOT hits and compared the within-family binding motif consensus. This analysis revealed a striking example of binding motif divergence in a C. albicans Rvs167 paralog, which cannot be explained by overall SH3 sequence or interface residue divergence, and we validated this specificity change with a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay. In addition, we show that position-weighted matrices (PWM) compiled from SPOT assays can be used for binding motif screening in potential binding partners and present cases where motifs are either conserved or lost among homologous SH3 interacting proteins. Finally, by comparing pairwise SH3 sequence identity to binding profile correlation we show that for {\~{}}75{\%} of all analyzed families the SH3 specificity profile was remarkably conserved over a large evolutionary distance. Thus, a high sequence identity within an SH3 domain family predicts conserved binding specificity, whereas divergence in sequence identity often coincided with a change in binding specificity within this family. As such, our results are important for future studies aimed at unraveling complex specificity networks of peptide recognition domains in higher eukaryotes, including mammals.},

abstract = {Many genes required for cell polarity development in budding yeast have been identified and arranged into a functional hierarchy. Core elements of the hierarchy are widely conserved, underlying cell polarity development in diverse eukaryotes. To enumerate more fully the protein–protein interactions that mediate cell polarity development, and to uncover novel mechanisms that coordinate the numerous events involved, we carried out a large-scale two-hybrid experiment. 68 Gal4 DNA binding domain fusions of yeast proteins associated with the actin cytoskeleton, septins, the secretory apparatus, and Rho-type GTPases were used to screen an array of yeast transformants that express ∼90{\%} of the predicted Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frames as Gal4 activation domain fusions. 191 protein–protein interactions were detected, of which 128 had not been described previously. 44 interactions implicated 20 previously uncharacterized proteins in cell polarity development. Further insights into possible roles of 13 of these proteins were revealed by their multiple two-hybrid interactions and by subcellular localization. Included in the interaction network were associations of Cdc42 and Rho1 pathways with proteins involved in exocytosis, septin organization, actin assembly, microtubule organization, autophagy, cytokinesis, and cell wall synthesis. Other interactions suggested direct connections between Rho1- and Cdc42-regulated pathways; the secretory apparatus and regulators of polarity establishment; actin assembly and the morphogenesis checkpoint; and the exocytic and endocytic machinery. In total, a network of interactions that provide an integrated response of signaling proteins, the cytoskeleton, and organelles to the spatial cues that direct polarity development was revealed.},

abstract = {Abplp is a yeast cortical actin-binding protein that contains an SH3 domain similar to those found in signal transduction proteins that function at the membrane/cytoskeleton interface. Although no detectable phenotypes are associated with a disruption allele of ABP1, mutations that create a requirement for this protein have now been isolated in the previously identified gene SAC6 and in two new genes, SLA1 and SLA2. The SAC6 gene encodes yeast fimbrin, an actin filament-bundling protein. Null mutations in SLA1 and SLA2 cause temperature-sensitive growth defects. Sla1p contains three SH3 domains and is essential for the proper formation of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The COOH terminus of Sla2p contains a 200 amino acid region with homology to the COOH terminus of talin, a membrane cytoskeletal protein which is a component of fibroblast focal adhesions. Sla2p is required for cellular morphogenesis and polarization of the cortical cytoskeleton. In addition, synthetic-lethal interactions were observed for double-mutants containing null alleles of SLA2 and SAC6. In total, the mutant phenotypes, sequences, and genetic interactions indicate that we have identified novel proteins that cooperate to control the dynamic cytoskeletal rearrangements that are required for the development of cell polarity in budding yeast.},

@article{Soulard2002b,
abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1Delta myo5Delta double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

abstract = {The present study uses a mathematical-empirical approach to estimate the cardinal growth temperature parameters (Tmin, the temperature below which growth is no longer observed; Topt, the temperature at which the $\mu$max equals its optimal value; $\mu$opt, the optimal value of $\mu$max; and Tmax, the temperature above which no growth occurs) of 27 yeast strains belonging to different Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces species. S. cerevisiae was the yeast best adapted to grow at high temperatures within the Saccharomyces genus, with the highest optimum (32.3°C) and maximum (45.4°C) growth temperatures. On the other hand, S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus var. uvarum showed the lowest optimum (23.6 and 26.2°C) and maximum (36.8 and 38.4°C) growth temperatures, respectively, confirming that both species are more psychrophilic than S. cerevisiae. The remaining Saccharomyces species (S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. arboricolus, and S. cariocanus) showed intermediate responses. With respect to the minimum temperature which supported growth, this parameter ranged from 1.3 (S. cariocanus) to 4.3°C (S. kudriavzevii). We also tested whether these physiological traits were correlated with the phylogeny, which was accomplished by means of a statistical orthogram method. The analysis suggested that the most important shift in the adaptation to grow at higher temperatures occurred in the Saccharomyces genus after the divergence of the S. arboricolus, S. mikatae, S. cariocanus, S. paradoxus, and S. cerevisiae lineages from the S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus var. uvarum lineages. Finally, our mathematical models suggest that temperature may also play an important role in the imposition of S. cerevisiae versus non-Saccharomyces species during wine fermentation.},

abstract = {Dynamic actin filaments are a crucial component of clathrin-mediated endocytosis when endocytic proteins cannot supply enough energy for vesicle budding. Actin cytoskeleton is thought to provide force for membrane invagination or vesicle scission, but how this force is transmitted to the plasma membrane is not understood. Here we describe the molecular mechanism of plasma membrane-actin cytoskeleton coupling mediated by cooperative action of epsin Ent1 and the HIP1R homolog Sla2 in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Sla2 anchors Ent1 to a stable endocytic coat by an unforeseen interaction between Sla2's ANTH and Ent1's ENTH lipid-binding domains. The ANTH and ENTH domains bind each other in a ligand-dependent manner to provide critical anchoring of both proteins to the membrane. The C-terminal parts of Ent1 and Sla2 bind redundantly to actin filaments via a previously unknown phospho-regulated actin-binding domain in Ent1 and the THATCH domain in Sla2. By the synergistic binding to the membrane and redundant interaction with actin, Ent1 and Sla2 form an essential molecular linker that transmits the force generated by the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane, leading to membrane invagination and vesicle budding.},

However, precise functional differences for the endophilin isoforms on synaptic vesicle (SV) endocytosis remain unknown.

The results showed that the amplitude of normalized evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents in endophilin1 knockdown neurons decreased significantly for both single train and multiple train stimulations. Similar results were found using endophilin2 knockdown neurons, whereas endophilin3 siRNA exhibited no change compared with control neurons. Endophilin1 and endophilin2 affected SV endocytosis, but the effect of endophilin1 and endophilin2 double knockdown was not different from that of either knockdown alone. This result suggested that endophilin1 and endophilin2 functioned together but not independently during SV endocytosis.

abstract = {FUS7 was previously identified by a mutation that causes a defect in cell fusion in a screen for bilateral mating defects. Here we show that FUS7 is allelic to RVS161/END6, a gene implicated in a variety of  processes including viability after starvation, endocytosis, and actin cytoskeletal organization. Two lines of evidence indicate that RVS161/END6's endocytic function is not required for cell fusion. First, several other  endocytic mutants showed no cell fusion defects. Second, we isolated five function-specific alleles of  RVS161/FUS7 that were defective for endocytosis, but  not mating, and three alleles that were defective for cell  fusion but not endocytosis. The organization of the actin cytoskeleton was normal in the cell fusion mutants,  indicating that Rvs161p's function in cell fusion is independent of actin organization. The three to fourfold induction of RVS161 by mating pheromone and the localization of Rvs161p-GFP to the cell fusion zone  suggested that Rvs161p plays a direct role in cell fusion.  The phenotypes of double mutants, the coprecipitation  of Rvs161p and Fus2p, and the fact that the stability of  Fus2p was strongly dependent on Rvs161p's mating  function lead to the conclusion that Rvs161p is required  to interact with Fus2p for efficient cell fusion.},

abstract = {The dynamin family of GTPases is essential for receptor-mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling, and it has recently been shown to play a role in vesicle formation from the trans–Golgi network. Dynamin is believed to assemble around the necks of clathrin-coated pits and assist in pinching vesicles from the plasma membrane. This role would make dynamin unique among GTPases in its ability to act as a mechanochemical enzyme. Data presented here demonstrate that purified recombinant dynamin binds to a lipid bilayer in a regular pattern to form helical tubes that constrict and vesiculate upon GTP addition. This suggests that dynamin alone is sufficient for the formation of constricted necks of coated pits and supports the hypothesis that dynamin is the force-generating molecule responsible for membrane fission.},

An intriguing characteristic of neuronal signal transduction is that endosomal trafficking enables physiological responses that vary based on the subcellular location of signal initiation.

While crystal structures of different BAR dimers advanced our understanding of membrane shaping by scaffolding and hydrophobic insertion mechanisms considerably, especially life-imaging techniques and loss-of-function studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis with its gradually increasing curvature show that the initial idea that solely BAR domain curvatures determine their functions is oversimplified. Diagonal placing, lateral lipid-binding modes, additional lipid-binding modules, tilde shapes and formation of macromolecular lattices with different modes of organisation and arrangement increase versatility. A picture emerges, in which BAR domain proteins create macromolecular platforms, that recruit and connect different binding partners and ensure the connection and coordination of the different events during the endocytic process, such as membrane invagination, coat formation, actin nucleation, vesicle size control, fission, detachment and uncoating, in time and space, and may thereby offer mechanistic explanations for how coordination, directionality and effectiveness of a complex process with several steps and key players can be achieved.},

abstract = {Endocytosis is a well-conserved process by which cells invaginate small portions of the plasma membrane to create vesicles containing extracellular and transmembrane cargo proteins. Dozens of proteins and hundreds of specific binding interactions are needed to coordinate and regulate these events. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a powerful model system to study clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Pan1 is thought to be a scaffolding protein due to its interactions with numerous proteins that act throughout the endocytic process. Previous research has characterized many Pan1 binding interactions, but due to Pan1's essential nature, the exact mechanisms of Pan1's function in endocytosis have been difficult to define. We created a novel Pan1-degron allele, Pan1-AID, in which Pan1 can be specifically and efficiently degraded in less than one hour upon addition of the plant hormone auxin. The loss of Pan1 caused a delay in endocytic progression and weakened connections between the coat/actin machinery and the membrane, leading to an arrest in CME. Additionally, we determined a critical role for the central region of Pan1 in endocytosis and viability. The regions important for endocytosis and viability can be separated suggesting that Pan1 may have a distinct role in the cell that is essential for viability.},

Numerous experimental and simulation efforts have revealed that calcium, a ubiquitous cellular messenger, has a strong impact on the phase behavior, structural properties, and the stability of membranes. Yet, it is still unknown the way calcium and lipid interactions affect their macroscopic mechanical properties. In this work, we studied the interaction of calcium ions with membrane tethers pulled from giant unilamellar vesicles, to quantify the mechanical effect on the membrane. We found that calcium imposes a positive spontaneous curvature on negatively charged membranes, contrary to predictions we made based on the proposed atomic structure. Surprisingly, this effect vanishes in the presence of physiologically relevant concentrations of sodium chloride. Our work implies that calcium may be a trigger for membrane reshaping only at high concentrations, in a process that is robustly screened by sodium ions.},

abstract = {alpha-factor, one of two peptide hormones responsible for synchronized mating between MATa and MAT alpha-cell types in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, binds to its cell surface receptor and is internalized in a time-, temperature-, and energy-dependent manner (Chvatchko, Y., I. Howald, and H. Riezman. 1986. Cell. 46:355-364). After internalization, alpha-factor is delivered to the vacuole via vesicular intermediates and degraded there consistent with an endocytic mechanism (Singer, B., and H. Riezman. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 110:1911-1922; Chvatchko, Y., I. Howald, and H. Riezman. 1986. Cell. 46:355-364). We have isolated two mutants that are defective in the internalization process. Both mutations confer a recessive, temperature-sensitive growth phenotype upon cells that cosegregates with their endocytosis defect. Lucifer yellow, a marker for fluid-phase endocytosis, shows accumulation characteristics in the mutants that are similar to the uptake characteristics of 35S-alpha-factor. The endocytic defect in end4 cells appears immediately upon shift to restrictive temperature and is reversible at permissive temperature if new protein synthesis is allowed. Furthermore, the end4 mutation only affects alpha-factor internalization and not the later delivery of alpha-factor to the vacuole. Other vesicle-mediated processes seem to be normal in end3 and end4 mutants. END3 and END4 are the first genes shown to be necessary for the internalization step of receptor-borne and fluid-phase markers in yeast.},

abstract = {BAR superfamily domains shape membranes through poorly understood mechanisms. We solved structures of F-BAR modules bound to flat and curved bilayers using electron (cryo)microscopy. We show that membrane tubules form when F-BARs polymerize into helical coats that are held together by lateral and tip-to-tip interactions. On gel-state membranes or after mutation of residues along the lateral interaction surface, F-BARs adsorb onto bilayers via surfaces other than their concave face. We conclude that membrane binding is separable from membrane bending, and that imposition of the module's concave surface forces fluid-phase bilayers to bend locally. Furthermore, exposure of the domain's lateral interaction surface through a change in orientation serves as the crucial trigger for assembly of the helical coat and propagation of bilayer bending. The geometric constraints and sequential assembly of the helical lattice explain how F-BAR and classical BAR domains segregate into distinct microdomains, and provide insight into the spatial regulation of membrane invagination.},

Morphological stages of vesicle formation are mirrored by progression through various protein modules (complexes). The process involves the formation of a putative FCH domain only (FCHO) initiation complex, which matures through adaptor protein 2 (AP2)-dependent cargo selection, and subsequent coat building, dynamin-mediated scission and finally auxilin- and heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70)-dependent uncoating.

abstract = {Summary
Endocytosis, like many dynamic cellular processes, requires precise temporal and spatial orchestration of complex protein machinery to mediate membrane budding. To understand how this machinery works, we directly correlated fluorescence microscopy of key protein pairs with electron tomography. We systematically located 211 endocytic intermediates, assigned each to a specific time window in endocytosis, and reconstructed their ultrastructure in 3D. The resulting virtual ultrastructural movie defines the protein-mediated membrane shape changes during endocytosis in budding yeast. It reveals that clathrin is recruited to flat membranes and does not initiate curvature. Instead, membrane invagination begins upon actin network assembly followed by amphiphysin binding to parallel membrane segments, which promotes elongation of the invagination into a tubule. Scission occurs on average 9 s after initial bending when invaginations are ∼100 nm deep, releasing nonspherical vesicles with 6,400 nm2 mean surface area. Direct correlation of protein dynamics with ultrastructure provides a quantitative 4D resource.},

In some cases, a BAR domain also possesses an amphipathic helix that inserts into the membrane to induce curvature. ACAP1 (Arfgap with Coil coil, Ankyrin repeat, and PH domain protein 1) contains a BAR domain. Here, we show that this BAR domain can neither bind membrane nor impart curvature, but instead requires a neighboring PH (Pleckstrin Homology) domain to achieve these functions. Specific residues within the PH domain are responsible for both membrane binding and curvature generation. The BAR domain adjacent to the PH domain instead interacts with the BAR domains of neighboring ACAP1 proteins to enable clustering at the membrane. Thus, we have uncovered the molecular basis for an unexpected and unconventional collaboration between PH and BAR domains in membrane bending.},

abstract = {In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the WASP (Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein) homologue Las17p (also called Bee1p) is an important component of cortical actin patches. Las17p is part of a high-molecular-weight protein complex that regulates Arp2/3 complex-dependent actin polymerization at the cell cortex and that includes the type I myosins Myo3p and Myo5p and verprolin (Vrp1p). To identify other factors implicated with this complex in actin regulation, we isolated proteins that bind to Las17p by two-hybrid screening and affinity chromatography. Here, we report the characterization of Lsb7/Bzz1p (for Las seventeen binding protein 7), an Src homology 3 (SH3) domain protein that interacts directly with Las17p via a polyproline-SH3 interaction. Bzz1p coimmunoprecipitates in a complex with Las17p, Vrp1p, Myo3/5p, Bbc1p, Hsp70p, and actin. It colocalizes with cortical actin patches and with Las17p. This localization is dependent on Las17p, but not on F-actin. Bzz1p interacts physically and genetically with type I myosins. While deletion of BZZ1 shows no obvious phenotype, simultaneous deletion of the BZZ1, MYO3, and MYO5 genes is lethal. Overexpression of Bzz1p inhibits cell growth, and a bzz1$\Delta$ myo5$\Delta$ double mutant is unable to restore actin polarity after NaCl stress. Finally, Bzz1p in vitro is able to recruit a functional actin polymerization machinery through its SH3 domains. Its interactions with Las17p, Vrp1p, and the type I myosins are essential for this process. This suggests that Bzz1p could be implicated in the regulation of actin polymerization.},

The molecular basis for the involvement of endocytic regulators in unconventional functions that influence the cytoskeleton, cell cycle, signaling, and gene regulation are described here. Through these additional functions, endocytic regulators participate in pathways that affect infection, glucose metabolism, development, and cellular transformation, expanding their significance in human health and disease.},

However, the timing of its formation and turnover, and its specific functions at different stages during endocytic internalization, have not been established. In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P(2) dynamics during endocytosis in yeast. Our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) levels increase and decline in conjunction with coat and actin assembly and disassembly, respectively. Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1Delta sjl2Delta mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P(2) levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

The fourth mutation is in END4, a gene identified previously. The end5-1, end6-1, and end7-1 mutations do not affect vacuolar protein localization, indicating that the defect in each mutant is specific for internalization at the plasma membrane. Inter-estingly, localization of actin patches on the plasma membrane is affected in each of the mutants. end5-1, end6-1, and end7-1 are allelic to VRP1, RVS161, and ACTI, respectively. VRP1 and RVS161 are required for correct actin localization and ACTi encodes actin. To our surprise, the end6 -1 mutation fails to complement the actl-l mutation. Disruption of the RVS167 gene, which is homologous to END6/RVS161 and which is also required for correct actin localization, also blocks endocytosis. The end7-1 mutant allele has a glycine 48 to aspartic acid substitution in the DNase I-binding loop of actin. We propose that Vrplp, Rvs161p, and Rvs167p are components of a cytoskeletal structure that contains actin and fimbrin and that is required for formation of endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {The ability to polarize is a fundamental property of cells. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has proven to be a fertile ground for dissecting the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell polarity during growth. Here we discuss the signaling pathways that regulate polarity. In the second installment of this two-part commentary, which appears in the next issue of Journal of Cell Science, we discuss how the actin cytoskeleton responds to these signals and guides the polarity of essentially all events in the yeast cell cycle. During the cell cycle, yeast cells assume alternative states of polarized growth, which range from tightly focused apical growth to non-focused isotropic growth. RhoGTPases, and in particular Cdc42p, are essential to guiding this polarity. The distribution of Cdc42p at the cell cortex establishes cell polarity. Cyclin-dependent protein kinase, Ras, and heterotrimeric G proteins all modulate yeast cell polarity in part by altering the distribution of Cdc42p. In turn, Cdc42p generates feedback signals to these molecules in order to establish stable polarity states and coordinate cytoskeletal organization with the cell cycle. Given that many of these signaling pathways are present in both fungi and animals, they are probably ancient and conserved mechanisms for regulating polarity.},

Large parts of the dynamin protein are highly conserved across species and this has enabled us in this study to select a number of disease causing mutations and to generate equivalent mutations in Vps1. We have then studied these mutants using both cellular and biochemical assays to ascertain functions of the protein that have been affected by the changes. Specifically, we demonstrate that the Vps1-G397R mutation (Dyn-2 G358R) disrupts protein oligomerization, Vps1-A447T (Dyn-1 A408T) affects the scission stage of endocytosis, while Vps1-R298L (Dyn-1 R256L) affects lipid binding specificity and possibly an early stage in endocytosis. Overall, we consider that the yeast model will potentially provide an avenue for rapid analysis of new dynamin mutations in order to understand the underlying mechanisms that they disrupt.},

abstract = {An improved lithium acetate (LiAc)/single-stranded DNA (SS-DNA)/polyethylene glycol (PEG) protocol which yields {\textgreater}1 × 106 transformants/$\mu$g plasmid DNA and the original protocol described by Schiestl and Gietz (1989) were used to investigate aspects of the mechanism of LiAc/SS-DNA/PEG transformation. The highest transformation efficiency was observed when 1 × 108 cells were transformed with 100 ng plasmid DNA in the presence of 50 $\mu$g SS carrier DNA. The yield of transformants increased linearly up to 5 $\mu$g plasmid per transformation. A 20-min heat shock at 42°C was necessary for maximal yields. PEG was found to deposit both carrier DNA and plasmid DNA onto cells. SS carrier DNA bound more effectively to the cells and caused tighter binding of 32P-labelled plasmid DNA than did double-stranded (DS) carrier. The LiAc/SS-DNA/PEG transformation method did not result in cell fusion. DS carrier DNA competed with DS vector DNA in the transformation reaction. SS plasmid DNA transformed cells poorly in combination with both SS and DS carrier DNA. The LiAc/SS-DNA/PEG method was shown to be more effective than other treatments known to make cells transformable. A model for the mechanism of transformation by the LiAc/SS-DNA/PEG method is discussed.},

abstract = {The fusion of neurotransmitter-filled vesicles during synaptic transmission is balanced by endocytotic membrane retrieval. Despite extensive research, the speed and mechanisms of synaptic vesicle endocytosis have remained controversial. Here, we establish low-noise time-resolved membrane capacitance measurements that allow monitoring changes in surface membrane area elicited by single action potentials and stronger stimuli with high-temporal resolution at physiological temperature in individual bona-fide mature central synapses. We show that single action potentials trigger very rapid endocytosis, retrieving presynaptic membrane with a time constant of 470 ms. This fast endocytosis is independent of clathrin but mediated by dynamin and actin. In contrast, stronger stimuli evoke a slower mode of endocytosis that is clathrin, dynamin, and actin dependent. Furthermore, the speed of endocytosis is highly temperature dependent with a Q10 of ∼3.5. These results demonstrate that distinct molecular modes of endocytosis with markedly different kinetics operate at central synapses.},

However, little is known about the spatio-temporal regulation of these interactions. Using fluorescence (cross)-correlation spectroscopy in yeast, we tested 41 previously reported interactions in vivo and found 16 to exist in the cytoplasm. These detected cytoplasmic interactions included the self-interaction of Ede1, homolog of mammalian Eps15. Ede1 is the crucial scaffold for the organization of the early stages of endocytosis. We show that oligomerization of Ede1 through its central coiled coil domain is necessary for its localization to the endocytic site and we link the oligomerization of Ede1 to its function in locally concentrating endocytic adaptors and organizing the endocytic machinery. Our study sheds light on the importance of the regulation of protein-protein interactions in the cytoplasm for the assembly of the endocytic machinery in vivo.},

abstract = {Phosphoinositides (PI) are synthesized and turned over by specific kinases, phosphatases, and lipases that ensure the proper localization of discrete PI isoforms at distinct membranes. We analyzed the role of the yeast synaptojanin-like proteins using a strain that expressed only a temperature-conditional allele of SJL2. Our analysis demonstrated that inactivation of the yeast synaptojanins leads to increased cellular levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)), accompanied by defects in actin organization, endocytosis, and clathrin-mediated sorting between the Golgi and endosomes. The phenotypes observed in synaptojanin-deficient cells correlated with accumulation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2), because these effects were rescued by mutations in MSS4 or a mutant form of Sjl2p that harbors only PI 5-phosphatase activity. We utilized green fluorescent protein-pleckstrin homology domain chimeras (termed FLAREs for fluorescent lipid-associated reporters) with distinct PI-binding specificities to visualize pools of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in yeast. PtdIns(4,5)P(2) localized to the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on Mss4p activity. On inactivation of the yeast synaptojanins, PtdIns(4,5)P(2) accumulated in intracellular compartments, as well as the cell surface. In contrast, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate generated by Pik1p localized in intracellular compartments. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the yeast synaptojanins control the localization of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) in vivo and provide further evidence for the compartmentalization of different PI species.},

However, the timing of its formation and turnover, and its specific functions at different stages during endocytic internalization, have not been established. In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics during endocytosis in yeast. Our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels increase and decline in conjunction with coat and actin assembly and disassembly, respectively. Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

abstract = {Two large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens were undertaken to identify protein–protein interactions between full-length open reading frames predicted from the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome sequence. In one approach, we constructed a protein array of about 6,000 yeast transformants, with each transformant expressing one of the open reading frames as a fusion to an activation domain. This array was screened by a simple and automated procedure for 192 yeast proteins, with positive responses identified by their positions in the array. In a second approach, we pooled cells expressing one of about 6,000 activation domain fusions to generate a library. We used a high-throughput screening procedure to screen nearly all of the 6,000 predicted yeast proteins, expressed as Gal4 DNA-binding domain fusion proteins, against the library, and characterized positives by sequence analysis. These approaches resulted in the detection of 957 putative interactions involving 1,004 S. cerevisiae proteins. These data reveal interactions that place functionally unclassified proteins in a biological context, interactions between proteins involved in the same biological function, and interactions that link biological functions together into larger cellular processes. The results of these screens are shown here.},

abstract = {Shallow hydrophobic insertions and crescent-shaped BAR scaffolds promote membrane curvature. Here, we investigate membrane fission by shallow hydrophobic insertions quantitatively and mechanistically. We provide evidence that membrane insertion of the ENTH domain of epsin leads to liposome vesiculation, and that epsin is required for clathrin-coated vesicle budding in cells. We also show that BAR-domain scaffolds from endophilin, amphiphysin, GRAF, and $\beta$2-centaurin limit membrane fission driven by hydrophobic insertions. A quantitative assay for vesiculation reveals an antagonistic relationship between amphipathic helices and scaffolds of N-BAR domains in fission. The extent of vesiculation by these proteins and vesicle size depend on the number and length of amphipathic helices per BAR domain, in accord with theoretical considerations. This fission mechanism gives a new framework for understanding membrane scission in the absence of mechanoenzymes such as dynamin and suggests how Arf and Sar proteins work in vesicle scission., Shallow hydrophobic deformations of a membrane by amphipathic helices not only cause changes in curvature but also drive complete fission. This reaction is limited by BAR domains that are often found in the same proteins with amphipathic helices, suggesting that in vivo the propensity for a membrane to vesiculate can be regulated by a combinatory effect associated with protein domains.},

Microinjection of amphiphysin's SH3 domain or of a dynamin peptide containing the SH3 binding site inhibited synaptic vesicle endocytosis at the stage of invaginated clathrin-coated pits, which resulted in an activity-dependent distortion of the synaptic architecture and a depression of transmitter release.

However, the resolution of these studies is insufficient to unveil how the endocytic machinery actually drives membrane deformation in vivo. In this study, we use quantitative immuno-EM to introduce the temporal dimension to the ultrastructural analysis of membrane budding and define changes in the topography of the lipid bilayer coupled to the dynamics of endocytic proteins with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution. Using this approach, we frame the emergence of membrane curvature with respect to the recruitment of endocytic factors and show that constriction of the invaginations correlates with translocation of membrane-sculpting proteins. Furthermore, we show that initial bending of the plasma membrane is independent of actin and clathrin polymerization and precedes building of an actin cap branched by the Arp2/3 complex. Finally, our data indicate that constriction and additional elongation of the endocytic profiles require the mechanochemical activity of the myosins-I. Altogether, this work provides major insights into the molecular mechanisms driving membrane deformation in a cellular context.},

abstract = {Tagging of genes by chromosomal integration of PCR amplified cassettes is a widely used and fast method to label proteins in vivo in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This strategy directs the amplified tags to the desired chromosomal loci due to flanking homologous sequences provided by the PCR-primers, thus enabling the selective introduction of any sequence at any place of a gene, e.g. for the generation of C-terminal tagged genes or for the exchange of the promoter and N-terminal tagging of a gene. To make this method most powerful we constructed a series of 76 novel cassettes, containing a broad variety of C-terminal epitope tags as well as nine different promoter substitutions in combination with N-terminal tags. Furthermore, new selection markers have been introduced. The tags include the so far brightest and most yeast-optimized version of the red fluorescent protein, called RedStar2, as well as all other commonly used fluorescent proteins and tags used for the detection and purification of proteins and protein complexes. Using the provided cassettes for N- and C-terminal gene tagging or for deletion of any given gene, a set of only four primers is required, which makes this method very cost-effective and reproducible. This new toolbox should help to speed up the analysis of gene function in yeast, on the level of single genes, as well as in systematic approaches.},

abstract = {Clathrin is a coat protein involved in vesicle budding from several membrane-bound compartments within the cell. Here we present an analysis of a temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant of clathrin heavy chain (CHC) in a multicellular animal. As expected Caenorhabditis elegans chc-1(b1025ts) mutant animals are defective in receptor-mediated endocytosis and arrest development soon after being shifted to the restrictive temperature. Steady-state clathrin levels in these mutants are reduced by more than 95{\%} at all temperatures. Hub interactions and membrane associations are lost at the restrictive temperature. chc-1(b1025ts) animals become paralyzed within minutes of exposure to the restrictive temperature because of a defect in the nervous system. Surprisingly synaptic vesicle number is not reduced in chc-1(b1025ts) animals. Consistent with the normal number of vesicles, postsynaptic miniature currents occur at normal frequencies. Taken together, these results indicate that a high level of CHC activity is required for receptor-mediated endocytosis in nonneuronal cells but is largely dispensable for maintenance of synaptic vesicle pools.},

abstract = {Learning, defined as a change in behaviour evoked by experience, has hitherto been investigated almost exclusively in multicellular neural organisms. Evidence for learning in non-neural multicellular organisms is scant, and only a few unequivocal reports of learning have been described in single-celled organisms. Here we demonstrate habituation, an unmistakable form of learning, in the non-neural organism Physarum polycephalum. In our experiment, using chemotaxis as the behavioural output and quinine or caffeine as the stimulus, we showed that P. polycephalum learnt to ignore quinine or caffeine when the stimuli were repeated, but responded again when the stimulus was withheld for a certain time. Our results meet the principle criteria that have been used to demonstrate habituation: responsiveness decline and spontaneous recovery. To distinguish habituation from sensory adaptation or motor fatigue, we also show stimulus specificity. Our results point to the diversity of organisms lacking neurons, which likely display a hitherto unrecognized capacity for learning, and suggest that slime moulds may be an ideal model system in which to investigate fundamental mechanisms underlying learning processes. Besides, documenting learning in non-neural organisms such as slime moulds is centrally important to a comprehensive, phylogenetic understanding of when and where in the tree of life the earliest manifestations of learning evolved.},

@article{Urbanek2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Actin nucleation is the key rate-limiting step in actin polymerization, and tight regulation of this process is critical to ensure that actin filaments form only at specific regions of the cell. Las17 is the primary activator of Arp2/3-driven actin nucleation in yeast and is required for membrane invagination during endocytosis. Its mammalian homolog, WASP, has also been studied extensively as an activator of Arp2/3-driven actin polymerization. In both Las17 and WASP, actin nucleation activity is attributed to an ability to bind actin through a WH2 domain and to bind Arp2/3 through an acidic region. The central region of both Las17 and WASP is rich in proline residues and is generally considered to bind to SH3-domain-containing proteins.
RESULTS: We have identified a novel actin-binding activity in the polyproline domain of both yeast Las17 and mammalian WASP. The polyproline domain of Las17 is also able to nucleate actin filaments independently of Arp2/3. Mutational analysis reveals that proline residues are required for this nucleation activity and that the binding site on actin maps to a region distinct from those used by other nucleation activities. In vivo analysis of yeast strains expressing las17 mutated in the WH2 domain, one of its proline motifs, or both shows additive defects in actin organization and endocytosis, with the proline mutant conferring more severe phenotypes than the WH2 mutant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate a new actin-binding and nucleation mechanism in Las17/WASP that is required for its function in actin regulation during endocytosis.},

Such vesicles have been seen associated with micropinocytosis. A simple and rapid procedure for the purification of coated vesicles from pig brain has been developed. The structures obtained have an external diameter of about 600 {\AA} and a remarkable network-like appearance. The most striking observation about these vesicles, reported here, is that they contain essentially just one protein species, having an apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulphate gels of about 180,000. Digestion of the coats with trypsin or Pronase shows that most of this protein is located on the external surface (i.e. facing the cytoplasm) of these structures. The lipid vesicles thus liberated appear to have an external diameter of about 350 {\AA}. An estimate of the number of protein molecules per vesicle is consistent with the coat having an icosahedral arrangement of subunits.},

Although the protein composition of the endocytic coat is known, its functional architecture is not well understood. Here we determine the nanoscale organization of the endocytic coat by FRET microscopy in yeast. We assessed proximities of 18 conserved coat-associated proteins and used clathrin subunits and protein truncations as molecular rulers to obtain a high-resolution protein map of the coat. Furthermore, we followed rearrangements of coat proteins during membrane invagination and their binding dynamics at the endocytic site. We show that the endocytic coat is stratified into several functional layers situated above and below the clathrin lattice with key proteins transversing through the lattice deeply into the cytoplasm. We propose that this conserved design enables an efficient and regulated function of the endocytic coat during endocytosis.},

Stress-inducible Ssa3p and Ssa4p are 80{\%} identical to Ssa1/2p. We show Ssa1p-4p have distinct functions affecting [PSI+] and [URE3] prions. When expressed as the only Ssa, Ssa1p antagonized [URE3] and Ssa2p antagonized [PSI+]. Ssa3p and Ssa4p influenced [URE3] and [PSI+] somewhat differently but overall their effects paralleled those of Ssa1p and Ssa2p, respectively. Additionally, Ssa3p suppressed a prion-inhibitory effect of elevated temperature. Our previously described Ssa1-21p mutant weakens [PSI+] in SSA1-21 SSA2 cells and abolishes it in SSA1-21 ssa2$\Delta$ cells. To test if the same mutation affected other prions or altered Ssa2p similarly, we compared effects of a constructed Ssa2-21p mutant and Ssa1-21p on both prions. Surprisingly, [URE3] was unaffected in SSA1-21 SSA2 cells and could propagate in SSA1-21 ssa2$\Delta$ cells. Ssa2-21p impaired [URE3] considerably and weakened [PSI+] strongly but in a manner distinct from Ssa1-21p, highlighting functional differences between these nearly identical Hsp70's. Our data uncover exquisite functional differences among isoforms of a highly homologous cytosolic Hsp70 subfamily and point to a possibility that variations in Hsp70 function that might improve fitness under optimal conditions are also important during stress.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Several different endocytic pathways have been proposed to function in mammalian cells. Clathrin-coated pits are well defined, but the identity, mechanism and function of alternative pathways have been controversial. Here we apply universal chemical labelling of plasma membrane proteins to define all primary endocytic vesicles, and labelling of specific proteins with a reducible SNAP-tag substrate. These approaches provide high temporal resolution and stringent discrimination between surface-connected and intracellular membranes. We find that at least 95{\%} of the earliest detectable endocytic vesicles arise from clathrin-coated pits. GPI-anchored proteins, candidate cargoes for alternate pathways, are also found to enter the cell predominantly via coated pits. Experiments employing a mutated clathrin adaptor reveal distinct mechanisms for sorting into coated pits, and thereby explain differential effects on the uptake of transferrin and GPI-anchored proteins. These data call for a revision of models for the activity and diversity of endocytic pathways in mammalian cells.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This has allowed us to identify mutations in eight VPL complementation groups that result in aberrant secretion of up to ∼90{\%} of the immunoreactive CPY. Other soluble vacuolar proteins are also affected by each vpl mutation, demonstrating that a sorting system for multiple vacuolar proteins exists in yeast. Mislocalized CPY apparently traverses late stages of the secretory pathway, since a vesicle-accumulating sec1 mutation prevents secretion of this protein. Despite the presence of abnormal membrane-enclosed organelles in some of the vpl mutants, maturation and secretion of invertase are not substantially perturbed. Thus vpl mutations define a new class of genes that encode products required for sorting of newly synthesized vacuolar proteins from secretory proteins during their transit through the yeast secretory pathway. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

Genes encoding members of this family have not yet been found in the genomes of prokaryotes, but within eukaryotes, BAR domain proteins are found universally from unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast through to plants, insects, and vertebrates. BAR domain proteins share an N-terminal BAR domain with a high propensity to adopt $\alpha$-helical structure and engage in coiled-coil interactions with other proteins. BAR domain proteins are implicated in processes as fundamental and diverse as fission of synaptic vesicles, cell polarity, endocytosis, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, transcriptional repression, cell-cell fusion, signal transduction, apoptosis, secretory vesicle fusion, excitation-contraction coupling, learning and memory, tissue differentiation, ion flux across membranes, and tumor suppression. What has been lacking is a molecular understanding of the role of the BAR domain protein in each process. The three-dimensional structure of the BAR domain has now been determined and valuable insight has been gained in understanding the interactions of BAR domains with membranes. The cellular roles of BAR domain proteins, characterized over the past decade in cells as distinct as yeasts, neurons, and myocytes, can now be understood in terms of a fundamental molecular function of all BAR domain proteins: to sense membrane curvature, to bind GTPases, and to mold a diversity of cellular membranes.},

Like Inp51p, the primary structures of Inp52p and Inp53p resemble the mammalian synaptic vesicle-associated protein, synaptojanin, and contain a carboxy-terminal catalytic domain and an amino-terminal SAC1-like segment. Inp51p (108 kD), Inp52p (136 kD) and Inp53p (124 kD) are membrane-associated. Single null mutants (inp51, inp52, or inp53) are viable. Both inp51 inp52 and inp52 inp53 double mutants display compromised cell growth, whereas an inp51 inp53 double mutant does not. An inp51 inp52 inp53 triple mutant is inviable on standard medium, but can grow weakly on media supplemented with an osmotic stabilizer (1 M sorbitol). An inp51 mutation, and to a lesser degree an inp52 mutation, confers cold-resistant growth in a strain background that cannot grow at temperatures below 15 degrees. Analysis of inositol metabolites in vivo showed measurable accumulation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate in the inp51 mutant. Electron microscopy revealed plasma membrane invaginations and cell wall thickening in double mutants and the triple mutant grown in sorbitol-containing medium. A fluorescent dye that detects endocytic and vacuolar membranes suggests that the vacuole is highly fragmented in inp51 inp52 double mutants. Our observations indicate that Inp51p, Inp52p, and Inp53p have distinct functions and that substrates and/or products of inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases may have roles in vesicle trafficking, membrane structure, and/or cell wall formation.},

These genes were annotated, and a large portion could be assigned to putative functional categories associated with basic metabolic processes, such as energy-generating processes and the biosynthesis and degradation of cellular building blocks. We further demonstrate, through computational screens (e.g., against a Medicago truncatula database) and direct hybridization on genomic DNA of diverse plant species, that these COS markers also are conserved in the genomes of other plant families. Finally, we show that this gene set can be used for comparative mapping studies between highly divergent genomes such as those of tomato and Arabidopsis. This set of COS markers, identified computationally and experimentally, may further studies on comparative genomes and phylogenetics and elucidate the nature of genes conserved throughout plant evolution.},

abstract = {Kinetochore capture and transport by spindle microtubules plays a crucial role in high-fidelity chromosome segregation, although its detailed mechanism has remained elusive. It has been difficult to observe individual kinetochore–microtubule interactions because multiple kinetochores are captured by microtubules during a short period within a small space. We have developed a method to visualize individual kinetochore–microtubule interactions in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, by isolating one of the kinetochores from others through regulation of the activity of a centromere. We detail this technique, which we call ‘centromere reactivation system', for dissection of the process of kinetochore capture and transport on mitotic spindle. Kinetochores are initially captured by the side of microtubules extending from a spindle pole, and subsequently transported poleward along them, which is an evolutionarily conserved process from yeast to vertebrate cells. Our system, in combination with amenable yeast genetics, has proved useful to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of kinetochore–microtubule interactions. We discuss practical considerations for applying our system to live cell imaging using fluorescence microscopy.},

abstract = {Endophilin 1 is a presynaptically enriched protein which binds the GTPase dynamin and the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synptojanin. Perturbation of endophilin function in cell-free systems and in a living synapse has implicated endophilin in endocytic vesicle budding (Ringstad, N., H. Gad, P. Low, G. Di Paolo, L. Brodin, O. Shupliakov, and P. De Camilli. 1999. Neuron. 24:143-154; Schmidt, A., M. Wolde, C. Thiele, W. Fest, H. Kratzin, A.V. Podtelejnikov, W. Witke, W.B. Huttner, and H.D. Soling. 1999.

Here, we show that purified endophilin can directly bind and evaginate lipid bilayers into narrow tubules similar in diameter to the neck of a clathrin-coated bud, providing new insight into the mechanisms through which endophilin may participate in membrane deformation and vesicle budding. This property of endophilin is independent of its putative lysophosphatydic acid acyl transferase activity, is mediated by its NH2-terminal region, and requires an amino acid stretch homologous to a corresponding region in amphiphysin, a protein previously shown to have similar effects on lipid bilayers (Takei, K., V.I. Slepnev, V. Haucke, and P. De Camilli. 1999. Nat. Cell Biol. 1:33-39). Endophilin cooligomerizes with dynamin rings on lipid tubules and inhibits dynamin's GTP-dependent vesiculating activity. Endophilin B, a protein with homology to endophilin 1, partially localizes to the Golgi complex and also deforms lipid bilayers into tubules, underscoring a potential role of endophilin family members in diverse tubulovesicular membrane-trafficking events in the cell.},

abstract = {Heterologous markers are important tools required for the molecular dissection of gene function in many organisms, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Moreover, the presence of gene families and isoenzymes often makes it necessary to delete more than one gene. We recently introduced a new and efficient gene disruption cassette for repeated use in budding yeast, which combines the heterologous dominant kanr resistance marker with a Cre/loxP-mediated marker removal procedure. Here we describe an additional set of four completely heterologous loxP-flanked marker cassettes carrying the genes URA3 and LEU2 from Kluyveromyces lactis, his5+ from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and the dominant resistance marker bler from the bacterial transposon Tn5, which confers resistance to the antibiotic phleomycin. All five loxP–marker gene–loxP gene disruption cassettes can be generated using the same pair of oligonucleotides and all can be used for gene disruption with high efficiency. For marker rescue we have created three additional Cre expression vectors carrying HIS3, TRP1 or bler as the yeast selection marker. The set of disruption cassettes and Cre expression plasmids described here represents a significant further development of the marker rescue system, which is ideally suited to functional analysis of the yeast genome.},

abstract = {Dynamins are a conserved family of proteins involved in many membrane fusion and fission events. Previously, the dynamin-related protein Vps1 was shown to localize to endocytic sites, and yeast carrying deletions for genes encoding both the BAR domain protein Rvs167 and Vps1 had a more severe endocytic scission defect than either deletion alone. Vps1 and Rvs167 localize to endocytic sites at the onset of invagination and disassemble concomitant with inward vesicle movement. Rvs167-GFP localization is reduced in cells lacking vps1 suggesting that Vps1 influences Rvs167 association with the endocytic complex. Unlike classical dynamins, Vps1 does not have a proline–arginine domain that could interact with SH3 domain-containing proteins. Thus, while Rvs167 has an SH3 domain, it is not clear how an interaction would be mediated. Here, we demonstrate an interaction between Rvs167 SH3 domain and the single type ISH3-binding motif in Vps1. Mutant Vps1 that cannot bind Rvs167 rescues all membrane fusion/fission functions associated with Vps1 except for endocytic function, demonstrating the specificity and mechanistic importance of the interaction. In vitro, an Rvs161/Rvs167 heterodimer can disassemble Vps1 oligomers. Overall, the data support the idea that Vps1 and the amphiphysins function together to mediate scission during endocytosis in yeast.},

We introduce new tools to track and count endocytic patches in fission yeast to increase the quality of the data extracted from quantitative microscopy movies. We present a universal method to achieve "temporal superresolution" by aligning temporal data sets with higher temporal resolution than the measurement intervals. These methods allowed us to extract new information about endocytic actin patches in wild-type cells from measurements of the fluorescence of fimbrin-mEGFP. We show that the time course of actin assembly and disassembly varies {\textless}600 ms between patches. Actin polymerizes during vesicle formation, but we show that polymerization does not participate in vesicle movement other than to limit the complex diffusive motions of newly formed endocytic vesicles, which move faster as the surrounding actin meshwork decreases in size over time. Our methods also show that the number of patches in fission yeast is proportional to cell length and that the variability in the repartition of patches between the tips of interphase cells has been underestimated.},

However, the timing of its formation and turnover, and its specific functions at different stages during endocytic internalization, have not been established. In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics during endocytosis in yeast. Our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels increase and decline in conjunction with coat and actin assembly and disassembly, respectively. Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

This hybrid module permits efficient selection of transformants resistant against geneticin (G418). We also constructed a lacZMT reporter module in which the open reading-frame of the E. coli lacZ gene (lacking the first 9 codons) is fused at its 3' end to the S. cerevisiae ADH1 terminator. KanMX and the lacZMT module, or both modules together, were cloned in the center of a new multiple cloning sequence comprising 18 unique restriction sites flanked by Not I sites. Using the double module for constructions of in-frame substitutions of genes, only one transformation experiment is necessary to test the activity of the promotor and to search for phenotypes due to inactivation of this gene. To allow for repeated use of the G418 selection some kanMX modules are flanked by 470 bp direct repeats, promoting in vivo excision with frequencies of 10(-3)-10(-4). The 1.4 kb kanMX module was also shown to be very useful for PCR based gene disruptions. In an experiment in which a gene disruption was done with DNA molecules carrying PCR-added terminal sequences of only 35 bases homology to each target site, all twelve tested geneticin-resistant colonies carried the correctly integrated kanMX module.},

abstract = {Vrp1p (verprolin, End5p) is the yeast ortholog of human Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-interacting protein (WIP). Vrp1p localizes to the cortical actin cytoskeleton, is necessary for its polarization to sites of growth and is also essential for endocytosis. At elevated temperature, Vrp1p becomes essential for growth. A C-terminal Vrp1p fragment (C-Vrp1p) retains the ability to localize to the cortical actin cytoskeleton and function in actin-cytoskeleton polarization, endocytosis and growth. Here, we demonstrate that two submodules in C-Vrp1p are required for actin-cytoskeleton polarization: a novel C-terminal actin-binding submodule (CABS) that contains a novel G-actin-binding domain, which we call a verprolin homology 2 C-terminal (VH2-C) domain; and a second submodule comprising the Las17p-binding domain (LBD) that binds Las17p (yeast WASP). The LBD localizes C-Vrp1p to membranes and the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Intriguingly, the LBD is sufficient to restore endocytosis and growth at elevated temperature to Vrp1p-deficient cells. The CABS also restores these functions, but only if modified by a lipid anchor to provide membrane association. Our findings highlight the role of Las17p binding for Vrp1p membrane association, suggest general membrane association may be more important than specific targeting to the cortical actin cytoskeleton for Vrp1p function in endocytosis and cell growth, and suggest that Vrp1p binding to individual effectors may alter their physiological activity.},

abstract = {Sequence analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IX identified a 946 amino acid open reading frame (YIL002C), designated here as INP51, that has carboxyl- and amino-terminal regions similar to mammalian inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases and to yeast SAC1. This two-domain primary structure resembles the mammalian 5-phosphatase, synaptojanin. We report that Inp51p is associated with a particulate fraction and that recombinant Inp51p exhibits intrinsic phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity. Deletion of INP51 (inp51) results in a "cold-tolerant" phenotype, enabling significantly faster growth at temperatures below 15 degreesC as compared with a parental strain. Complementation analysis of an inp51 mutant strain demonstrates that the cold tolerance is strictly due to loss of 5-phosphatase catalytic activity. Furthermore, deletion of PLC1 in an inp51 mutant does not abrogate cold tolerance, indicating that Plc1p-mediated production of soluble inositol phosphates is not required. Cells lacking INP51 have a 2-4-fold increase in levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate, whereas cells overexpressing Inp51p exhibit a 35{\%} decrease in levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. We conclude that INP51 function is critical for proper phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate homeostasis. In addition, we define a novel role for a 5-phosphatase loss of function mutant that improves the growth of cells at colder temperatures without alteration of growth at normal temperatures, which may have useful commercial applications.},

abstract = {Electron microscopy of various tissues has revealed the existence of intracellular vesicles with “coats” on their cytoplasmic surfaces. Such vesicles have been seen associated with micropinocytosis. A simple and rapid procedure for the purification of coated vesicles from pig brain has been developed. The structures obtained have an external diameter of about 600 {\AA} and a remarkable network-like appearance. The most striking observation about these vesicles, reported here, is that they contain essentially just one protein species, having an apparent molecular weight on sodium dodecyl sulphate gels of about 180,000. Digestion of the coats with trypsin or Pronase shows that most of this protein is located on the external surface (i.e. facing the cytoplasm) of these structures. The lipid vesicles thus liberated appear to have an external diameter of about 350 {\AA}. An estimate of the number of protein molecules per vesicle is consistent with the coat having an icosahedral arrangement of subunits.},

Dynamin and its related proteins are essential to many cell functions, from endocytosis to organelle division and fusion, and it plays a critical role in many physiological functions such as synaptic transmission and muscle contraction. Research of the past three decades has focused on understanding how dynamin works. In this review, we present the basis for an emerging consensus on how dynamin functions. Three properties of dynamin are strongly supported by experimental data: first, dynamin oligomerizes into a helical polymer; second, dynamin oligomer constricts in the presence of GTP; and third, dynamin catalyzes membrane fission upon GTP hydrolysis. We present the two current models for fission, essentially diverging in how GTP energy is spent. We further discuss how future research might solve the remaining open questions presently under discussion.},

Mutations were systematically targeted to the surface of the protein by identifying clusters of 2 or more charged residues in the primary sequence; every charged residue in a cluster was replaced with alanine. Mutations were recovered in high yield (34 of 36 constructed) as heterozygous diploids. Mutant phenotypes were examined in haploid segregants: 11 were recessive lethal, 16 conditional-lethal (including temperature-sensitive and salt-sensitive) and 7 had no discernible phenotype. Genetic analysis suggested that the two mutations constructed but not recovered in yeast may have a dominant defective phenotype. Location of the mutant residues on the three-dimensional structure of the rabbit muscle actin monomer confirmed that most (81{\%}) of the charged residues we altered lie at or near the surface of the protein, confirming a key assumption of the method. Many of the new act1 alleles have properties readily interpreted in light of the actin structure and should prove useful in both genetic and biochemical studies of actin function.},

Its underlying molecular mechanism, however, is only incompletely understood. Recently, experiments and computer simulation studies have revealed that dynamin-mediated membrane fission is a two-step process that proceeds via a metastable hemi-fission intermediate (or wormlike micelle) formed by dynamin's constriction. Importantly, this hemi-fission intermediate is remarkably metastable, i.e., its subsequent rupture that completes the fission process does not occur spontaneously but requires additional, external effects, e.g., dynamin's (unknown) conformational changes or membrane tension. Using simulations of a coarse-grained, implicit-solvent model of lipid membranes, we investigate the molecular mechanism of rupturing the hemi-fission intermediate, such as its pathway, the concomitant transition states, and barriers, as well as the role of membrane tension.

Using multicolor real-time fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking algorithms, we define an early endocytic pathway wherein an invariant sequence of changes in cortical patch protein composition correlates with changes in patch motility. Three Arp2/3 activators each showed a distinct behavior, suggesting distinct patch-related endocytic functions. Actin polymerization occurs late in the endocytic pathway and is required both for endocytic internalization and for patch disassembly. In cells lacking the highly conserved endocytic protein Sla2p, patch motility was arrested and actin comet tails associated with endocytic patch complexes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of the actin comet tails revealed that endocytic complexes are nucleation sites for rapid actin polymerization. Attention is now focused on the mechanisms by which the order and timing of events in this endocytic pathway are achieved.},

With its N-terminal amphipathic helix and BAR domain (N-BAR), amphiphysin can drive membrane curvature in vitro and in vivo. The structure is similar to that of arfaptin2, which we find also binds and tubulates membranes. From this, we predict that BAR domains are in many protein families, including sorting nexins, centaurins, and oligophrenins.

abstract = {Endocytosis is a dynamic process that cells use to take up their plasma membrane. Many proteins that function in endocytosis are known, and an extensive network of protein interactions occurs between these endocytic proteins. As a result identifying where and how these endocytic proteins function in the endocytic pathway has been challenging. Live-cell imaging studies have shown that a precisely choreographed assembly of proteins occurs at endocytic sites in both budding yeast and mammals, but these studies have only examined a handful of the over 50 proteins that function in endocytosis. Here the effects of over 60 deletion mutants on the dynamics of the budding yeast endocytic pathway were studied, revealing functions for 20 proteins. In addition to the previously analyzed endocytic proteins, novel spatio-temporal dynamics were described for ∼35 proteins at endocytic sites, indicating that at least 50 proteins associate with endocytic sites. Analyzing deletion phenotypes and spatio-temporal dynamics of endocytic proteins provided evidence for four protein modules that cooperate to drive budding yeast endocytosis. These studies determined that budding yeast endocytosis is clathrin-mediated. Furthermore, actin polymerization at the plasma membrane was found to play an essential role in driving endocytic internalization. A critical role for yeast amphiphysins in facilitating vesicle scission was also discovered. Finally, a complex pathway was uncovered for regulating disassembly of the endocytic coat after internalization. Overall, these studies have yielded a comprehensive understanding of the events that occur during budding yeast endocytosis.},

Rvs167p colocalized with actin patches during yeast vegetative growth and mating. Complete disruption of the actin cytoskeleton using Latrunculin-A did not affect Rvs167p localization in patches throughout the cell. In rvs167 mutant cells, actin patches are mislocalized and in rvs161 or abp1 mutant cells, Rvs167p localization is not affected. These observations suggest that Rvs167p may localize the actin cortical complex properly. Finally, the amphiphysin-conserved N-terminal domain of Rvs167p, called the BAR domain, was required but not sufficient for the correct localization of the protein.},

abstract = {BAR family proteins are a unique class of adaptor proteins characterized by a common N-terminal fold of undetermined function termed the BAR domain. This set of adaptors, which includes the mammalian proteins amphiphysin and Bin1 and the yeast proteins Rvs167p and Rvs161p, has been implicated in diverse cellular processes, including synaptic vesicle endocytosis, actin regulation, differentiation, cell survival, and tumorigenesis. Here we report the identification and characterization of Bin2, a novel protein that contains a BAR domain but that is otherwise structurally dissimilar to other members of the BAR adaptor family. The Bin2 gene is located at chromosome 4q22.1 and is expressed predominantly in hematopoietic cells. Bin2 is upregulated during differentiation of granulocytes, suggesting that it functions in that lineage. Bin2 formed a stable complex in cells with Bin1, but not with amphiphysin, in a BAR domain-dependent manner. This finding indicates that BAR domains have specific preferences for interaction. However, Bin2 did not influence endocytosis in the same manner as brain-specific splice isoforms of Bin1, nor did it exhibit the tumor suppressor properties inherent to ubiquitous splice isoforms of Bin1. Thus, Bin2 appears to encode a nonredundant function in the BAR adaptor gene family.},

abstract = {Eukaryotic cells contain many different membrane compartments with characteristic shapes, lipid compositions, and dynamics. A large fraction of cytoplasmic proteins associate with these membrane compartments. Such protein-lipid interactions, which regulate the subcellular localizations and activities of peripheral membrane proteins, are fundamentally important for a variety of cell biological processes ranging from cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane trafficking to intracellular signaling. Reciprocally, many membrane-associated proteins can modulate the shape, lipid composition, and dynamics of cellular membranes. Determining the exact mechanisms by which these proteins interact with membranes will be essential to understanding their biological functions. In this Technical Perspective, we provide a brief introduction to selected biochemical methods that can be applied to study protein-lipid interactions. We also discuss how important it is to choose proper lipid composition, type of model membrane, and biochemical assay to obtain reliable and informative data from the lipid-interaction mechanism of a protein of interest.},

In addition to the landmark collection of 35 essays by pioneers of molecular biology, this edition contains an additional essay by Sydney Brenner, one of the few influential molecular biologists of the time not to contribute to the original book. The essay contains material prepared for the original edition, but not submitted at the time, and a newly written view of the phage group seen from the perspective of someone close to, but not an intimate member of, that famous school. This new edition also retains material added to the expanded 1992 edition, including Gunther Stent's obituary of Max Delbr ck, two commentaries on issues raised in the book reprinted from Scientific American and Science, and the preface in which John Cairns reflects on the book's creation and molecular biology's age of innocence. On first publication, the book was hailed as [introducing] into the literature of science, for the first time, a self-conscious historical element in which the participants in scientific discovery engage in writing their own chronicle. As such, it is an important document in the history of biology... (Journal of History of Biology). And in another review it was described as required reading for every student of experimental biology... [who] will sense the smell and rattle of the laboratory (Bioscience). The book was a formative influence on many of today's leading scientists.},

abstract = {Ultrafast endocytosis generates vesicles from the plasma membrane as quickly as 50 ms in hippocampal neurons following synaptic vesicle fusion. The molecular mechanism underlying the rapid maturation of these endocytic pits is not known. Here we demonstrate that synaptojanin-1, and its partner endophilin-A, function in ultrafast endocytosis. In the absence of synaptojanin or endophilin, the membrane is rapidly invaginated, but pits do not become constricted at the base. The 5-phosphatase activity of synaptojanin is involved in formation of the neck, but 4-phosphatase is not required. Nevertheless, these pits are eventually cleaved into vesicles; within a 30-s interval, synaptic endosomes form and are resolved by clathrin-mediated budding. Then synaptojanin and endophilin function at a second step to aid with the removal of clathrin coats from the regenerated vesicles. These data together suggest that synaptojanin and endophilin can mediate membrane remodeling on a millisecond timescale during ultrafast endocytosis.},

The mutant exhibits the same response when cells are grown in high salt concentrations and other unfavorable growth conditions. The RVS167 gene product displays significant homology with the Rvs161 protein and contains a SH3 domain at the C-terminal end. Abnormal actin distribution is associated with the mutant phenotype. In addition, while the budding pattern of haploid strains remains axial in standard growth conditions, the budding pattern of diploid mutant strains is random. The gene RVS167 therefore could be implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization in response to environmental stresses and could act in the budding site selection mechanism.},

Here, we used evanescent field (EF) microscopy to observe single clathrin-coated pits or vesicles as they draw inwards from the plasma membrane and finally lose their coats. This inward movement occurred immediately after a brief burst of dynamin recruitment and was accompanied by transient actin assembly. Therefore, dynamin may provide the trigger and actin may provide the force for movement into the cytosol.},

@article{Benmerah1999,
abstract = {Recent data have shown that Eps15, a newly identified component of clathrin-coated pits constitutively associated with the AP-2 complex, is required for receptor-mediated endocytosis. However, its precise function remains unknown. Interestingly, Eps15 contains three EH (Eps15-Homology) domains also found in proteins required for the internalization step of endocytosis in yeast. Results presented here show that EH domains are required for correct coated pit targeting of Eps15. Furthermore, when cells expressed an Eps15 mutant lacking EH domains, the plasma membrane punctate distribution of both AP-2 and clathrin was lost, implying the absence of coated pits. This was further confirmed by the fact that dynamin, a GTPase found in coated pits, was homogeneously redistributed on the plasma membrane and that endocytosis of transferrin, a specific marker of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, was strongly inhibited. Altogether, these results strongly suggest a role for Eps15 in coated pit assembly and more precisely a role for Eps15 in the docking of AP-2 onto the plasma membrane. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that a GFP fusion protein encoding the ear domain of (alpha)-adaptin, the AP-2 binding site for Eps15, was efficiently targeted to plasma membrane coated pits.},

The actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex, and there is growing evidence that F-actin plays a direct role in these endocytic events. Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process. Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide powerful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites. In this review, we focus on progress made in elucidating the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis.},

In Part I of this two-part commentary, presented in the previous issue of Journal of Cell Science, we discussed the basis by which yeast establishes and maintains different states of polarity through Ρ GTPases and cyclin-dependent protein kinase signaling. Here we discuss how, in response to those signals, the actin cytoskeleton guides growth of the yeast cell. A polarized array of actin cables at the cell cortex is the primary structural determinant of polarity. Motors such as class V myosins use this array to transport secretory vesicles, mRNA and organelles towards growth sites, where they are anchored by a cap of cytoskeletal and regulatory proteins. Cortical actin patches enhance and maintain this polarity, probably through endocytic recycling, which allows reuse of materials and prevents continued growth at old sites. The dynamic arrangement of targeting and recycling provides flexibility for the precise control of morphogenesis.},

We found that unlike some forms of amphiphysin, Rvs161p-Rvs167p acts as an obligate heterodimer during vegetative growth and neither Rvs161p nor Rvs167p forms a homodimer in vivo. RVS161 and RVS167 have an identical set of 49 synthetic lethal interactions, revealing functions for the Rvs proteins in cell polarity, cell wall synthesis, and vesicle trafficking as well as a shared role in mating. Consistent with these roles, we show that the Rvs167p-Rvs161p heterodimer, like its amphiphysin homologues, can bind to phospholipid membranes in vitro, suggesting a role in vesicle formation and/or fusion. Our genetic screens also reveal that the interaction between Abp1p and the Rvs167p Src homology 3 (SH3) domain may be important under certain conditions, providing the first genetic evidence for a role for the SH3 domain of Rvs167p. Our studies implicate heterodimerization of amphiphysin family proteins in various functions related to cell polarity, cell integrity, and vesicle trafficking during vegetative growth and the mating response.},

abstract = {During hyperosmotic shock, Saccharomyces cerevisiae adjusts to physiological challenges, including large plasma membrane invaginations generated by rapid cell shrinkage. Calcineurin, the Ca2+/calmodulin–dependent phosphatase, is normally cytosolic but concentrates in puncta and at sites of polarized growth during intense osmotic stress; inhibition of calcineurin-activated gene expression suggests that restricting its access to substrates tunes calcineurin signaling specificity. Hyperosmotic shock promotes calcineurin binding to and dephosphorylation of the PI(4,5)P2 phosphatase synaptojanin/Inp53/Sjl3 and causes dramatic calcineurin-dependent reorganization of PI(4,5)P2-enriched membrane domains. Inp53 normally promotes sorting at the trans-Golgi network but localizes to cortical actin patches in osmotically stressed cells. By activating Inp53, calcineurin repolarizes the actin cytoskeleton and maintains normal plasma membrane morphology in synaptojanin-limited cells. In response to hyperosmotic shock and calcineurin-dependent regulation, Inp53 shifts from associating predominantly with clathrin to interacting with endocytic proteins Sla1, Bzz1, and Bsp1, suggesting that Inp53 mediates stress-specific endocytic events. This response has physiological and molecular similarities to calcineurin-regulated activity-dependent bulk endocytosis in neurons, which retrieves a bolus of plasma membrane deposited by synaptic vesicle fusion. We propose that activation of Ca2+/calcineurin and PI(4,5)P2 signaling to regulate endocytosis is a fundamental and conserved response to excess membrane in eukaryotic cells.},

@article{Basu2014,
abstract = {Yeast and other walled cells possess high internal turgor pressure that allows them to grow and survive in the environment. This turgor pressure, however, may oppose the invagination of the plasma membrane needed for endocytosis. Here we study the effects of turgor pressure on endocytosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by time-lapse imaging of individual endocytic sites. Decreasing effective turgor pressure by addition of sorbitol to the media significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process before actin assembly and membrane ingression but does not affect the velocity or depth of ingression of the endocytic pit in wild-type cells. Sorbitol also rescues endocytic ingression defects of certain endocytic mutants and of cells treated with a low dose of the actin inhibitor latrunculin A. Endocytosis proceeds after removal of the cell wall, suggesting that the cell wall does not contribute mechanically to this process. These studies suggest that endocytosis is governed by a mechanical balance between local actin-dependent inward forces and opposing forces from high internal turgor pressure on the plasma membrane.},

@article{Huckaba2004,
abstract = {Using FM4-64 to label endosomes and Abp1p-GFP or Sac6p-GFP to label actin patches, we find that (1) endosomes colocalize with actin patches as they assemble at the bud cortex; (2) endosomes colocalize with actin patches as they undergo linear, retrograde movement from buds toward mother cells; and (3) actin patches interact with and disassemble at FM4-64–labeled internal compartments. We also show that retrograde flow of actin cables mediates retrograde actin patch movement. An Arp2/3 complex mutation decreases the frequency of cortical, nonlinear actin patch movements, but has no effect on the velocity of linear, retrograde actin patch movement. Rather, linear actin patch movement occurs at the same velocity and direction as the movement of actin cables. Moreover, actin patches require actin cables for retrograde movements and colocalize with actin cables as they undergo retrograde movement. Our studies support a mechanism whereby actin cables serve as “conveyor belts” for retrograde movement and delivery of actin patches/endosomes to FM4-64–labeled internal compartments.},

abstract = {The GTPase dynamin, a key player in endocytic membrane fission, interacts with numerous proteins that regulate actin dynamics and generate/sense membrane curvature. To determine the functional relationship between these proteins and dynamin, we have analyzed endocytic intermediates that accumulate in cells that lack dynamin (derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice). In these cells, actin-nucleating proteins, actin, and BAR domain proteins accumulate at the base of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where they support the growth of dynamic long tubular necks. These results, which we show reflect the sequence of events in wild-type cells, demonstrate a concerted action of these proteins prior to, and independent of, dynamin and emphasize similarities between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Our data also demonstrate that the relationship between dynamin and actin is intimately connected to dynamin's endocytic role and that dynamin terminates a powerful actin- and BAR protein-dependent tubulating activity.},

Here, we studied membrane tube pulling in ternary mixtures of sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. Two salient results emerged: the lipid composition is significantly different in the tubes and in the vesicles; tube fission is observed when phase separation is generated in the tubes. This shows that lipid sorting may depend critically on both membrane curvature and phase separation. Phase separation also appears to be important for membrane fission in tubes pulled out of giant liposomes or purified Golgi membranes.},

@techreport{Tilney,
abstract = {After Listeria, a bacterium, is phagocytosed by a macrophage, it dissolves the phagosomal membrane and enters the cytoplasm. The Listeria then nu-cleates actin filaments from its surface. These newly assembled actin filaments show unidirectional polarity with their barbed ends associated with the surface of the Listeria. Using actin concentrations below the pointed end critical concentration we find that filament elongation must be occurring by monomers adding to the barbed ends, the ends associated with the Listerial surface. If Listeria with tails are incubated in G actin under polymerizing conditions, the Listeria is translo-cated away from its preformed tail by the elongation of filaments attached to the Listeria. This experiment and others tell us that in vivo filament assembly must be tightly coupled to filament capping and cross-bridging so that if one process outstrips another, chaos ensues. We also show that the actin filaments in the tail are capped on their pointed ends which inhibits further elongation and/or disassembly in vitro. From these re-suits we suggest a simple picture of how Listeria competes effectively for host cell actin. When Listeria secretes a nucleator, the host's actin subunits polymerize into a filament. Host cell machinery terminate the assembly leaving a short filament. Listeria overcomes the host control by nucleating new filaments and thus many short filaments assemble. The newest filaments push existing ones into a growing tail. Thus the competition is between nucleation of filaments caused by Listeria and the filament terminators produced by the host.},

Among the most significant ones, 24 ORFs were specific preys of Rvs167p only and two gave interactions with Rvs161p only.

abstract = {The membrane bending and GTPase-binding functions of proteins from the BAR-domain family, BAR-domains recently took centre stage in science through a report on the crystal structure of this domain in Drosophila Amphiphysin. Though only weakly conserved at the sequence level, the structure of the BAR domain shows striking similarity to the GTPase-binding domain of Arfaptin 2, an effector of Rho- and Arf- GTPases. On the basis of this sequence and structural similarity, these two proteins have been classified as belonging to the same family, the BAR-domain family, and they probably also have similar functional characteristics. Presented here are the results of a database search for the sequence of the BAR domain of Amphiphysin and Arfaptin 2. This search identified a variety of related proteins, most of which are involved in intracellular transport and especially in endocytosis. For example, the BAR-domain family includes Endophilins, GTPase-activating proteins of the Centaurin$\beta$ family and Oligophrenins, the adaptor proteins APPL1 and APPL2 that were recently shown to interact with the small GTPase Rab5, as well as members of the Sorting nexin family. On the basis of the structures of Amphiphysin and Arfaptin 2 and the cellular role of Amphiphysins in the early steps of endocytosis, the functions of the BAR domain have been defined as a dimerization motif and as sensing and inducing membrane curvature. However, data on Arfaptin 2 and now also on the Adaptor proteins APPL1 and 2 suggest that another function of the BAR domain is to bind to small GTPases.},

abstract = {Mammalian dynamin is responsible for scission of endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane. A previous study showed that Vps1, a yeast dynamin-like protein, plays an important role in pheromone receptor internalization (Yu and Cai, 2004; J. Cell Sci. 117, 3839-3853). However, the details of how Vps1 acts in various phases of endocytosis including early internalization of the endocytic vesicle are poorly understood. To investigate the potential roles of Vps1 in both endocytic vesicle formation/maturation on the plasma membrane and endocytic vesicle internalization, time-lapse fluorescent images of GFP-tagged endocytic markers in live cells were analyzed using a particle tracking software. The loss of Vps1 leads to a robust increase in the lifespan of newly forming cortical endocytic vesicles carrying Las17-GFP, Ede1-GFP, Sla1-GFP, and Abp1-GFP, indicating that Vps1 is required for the proper assembly and maturation of endocytic vesicles. Particle track analysis revealed that Abp1-GFP vesicles in vps1 null cells moved a relatively short distance away from the cell membrane due to their non-directional movement. Furthermore, we found that the GTPase and the GED domains of Vps1 are required for the proper endocytic function of Vps1. Our tracking analysis data also revealed that the post-internalized vesicle motility en route to the vacuole was decreased significantly, perhaps due to severe disruption of the actin cables in Vps1 mutant cells.},

abstract = {Amphiphysin, a protein that is highly concentrated in nerve terminals, has been proposed to function as a linker between the clathrin coat and dynamin in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Here, using a cell-free system, we provide direct morphological evidence in support of this hypothesis. Unexpectedly, we also find that amphiphysin-1, like dynamin-1, can transform spherical liposomes into narrow tubules. Moreover, amphiphysin-1 assembles with dynamin-1 into ring-like structures around the tubules and enhances the liposome-fragmenting activity of dynamin-1 in the presence of GTP. These results show that amphiphysin binds lipid bilayers, indicate a potential function for amphiphysin in the changes in bilayer curvature that accompany vesicle budding, and imply a close functional partnership between amphiphysin and dynamin in endocytosis.},

@article{Chang-Ileto2011,
abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P₂] plays a fundamental role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, precisely how PI(4,5)P₂ metabolism is spatially and temporally regulated during membrane internalization and the functional consequences of endocytosis-coupled PI(4,5)P₂ dephosphorylation remain to be explored. Using cell-free assays with liposomes of varying diameters, we show that the major synaptic phosphoinositide phosphatase, synaptojanin 1 (Synj1), acts with membrane curvature generators/sensors, such as the BAR protein endophilin, to preferentially remove PI(4,5)P₂ from curved membranes as opposed to relatively flat ones. Moreover, in vivo recruitment of Synj1's inositol 5-phosphatase domain to endophilin-induced membrane tubules results in fragmentation and condensation of these structures largely in a dynamin-dependent fashion. Our study raises the possibility that geometry-based mechanisms may contribute to spatially restricting PI(4,5)P₂ elimination during membrane internalization and suggests that the PI(4,5)P₂-to-PI4P conversion achieved by Synj1 at sites of high curvature may cooperate with dynamin to achieve membrane fission.},

@article{Brach2014,
abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is driven by a complex machinery of proteins, which assemble in a regular order at the plasma membrane [1–3]. The assembly of the endocytic machinery is conventionally thought to be a continuous process of mechanistically dependent steps, starting from a defined initiation step. Indeed, several initiation mechanisms involving single proteins have been proposed in mammalian cells [4, 5]. Here, we demonstrate that the initiation mechanism of endocytosis is highly flexible. We disrupted the long early phase of endocytosis in yeast by deleting seven genes encoding early endocytic proteins. Surprisingly, membrane uptake and vesicle budding dynamics were largely normal in these mutant cells. Regulated cargo recruitment was, however, defective. In addition, different early endocytic proteins were able to initiate vesicle budding when anchored to a plasma membrane domain where endocytosis does not normally take place. Our results suggest that the cargo-recruiting early phase is not mechanistically required for vesicle budding, but early-arriving proteins can recruit the budding machinery into position at the plasma membrane. Separable early and late phases allow for a robust process of vesicle budding to follow from variable initiation mechanisms. Such a modular design could easily adapt and evolve to respond to different cellular requirements.},

S. cerevisiae was the yeast best adapted to grow at high temperatures within the Saccharomyces genus, with the highest optimum (32.3°C) and maximum (45.4°C) growth temperatures. On the other hand, S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus var. uvarum showed the lowest optimum (23.6 and 26.2°C) and maximum (36.8 and 38.4°C) growth temperatures, respectively, confirming that both species are more psychrophilic than S. cerevisiae. The remaining Saccharomyces species (S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. arboricolus, and S. cariocanus) showed intermediate responses. With respect to the minimum temperature which supported growth, this parameter ranged from 1.3 (S. cariocanus) to 4.3°C (S. kudriavzevii). We also tested whether these physiological traits were correlated with the phylogeny, which was accomplished by means of a statistical orthogram method. The analysis suggested that the most important shift in the adaptation to grow at higher temperatures occurred in the Saccharomyces genus after the divergence of the S. arboricolus, S. mikatae, S. cariocanus, S. paradoxus, and S. cerevisiae lineages from the S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus var. uvarum lineages. Finally, our mathematical models suggest that temperature may also play an important role in the imposition of S. cerevisiae versus non-Saccharomyces species during wine fermentation.},

abstract = {Expression of the GAL1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is strongly repressed by growth on glucose. We show that two sites within the GAL1 promoter mediate glucose repression. First, glucose inhibits transcription activation by GAL4 protein through UASG. Second, a promoter element, termed URSG, confers glucose repression independently of GAL4. We have localized the URSG sequences responsible for glucose repression to an 87-base-pair fragment located between UASG and the TATA box. Promoters deleted for small (20-base-pair) segments that span this sequence are still subject to glucose repression, suggesting that there are multiple sequences within this region that confer repression. Extended deletions across this region confirm that it contains at least two and possibly three URSG elements. To identify the gene products that confer repression upon UASG and URSG, we have analyzed glucose repression mutants and found that the GAL83, REG1, GRR1, and SSN6 genes are required for repression mediated by both UASG and URSG. In contrast, GAL82 and HXK2 are required only for UASG repression. A mutation designated urr1-1 (URSG repression resistant) was identified that specifically relieves URSG repression without affecting UASG repression. In addition, we observed that the SNF1-encoded protein kinase is essential for derepression of both UASG and URSG. We propose that repression of UASG and URSG is mediated by two independent pathways that respond to a common signal generated by growth on glucose.},

These mutants were identified by selecting for cells that mislocalize vacuolar proteins to the cell surface. Morphological examination of the vpl mutants indicated that most contain vacuoles of normal appearance; however, some of the mutants generally lack a large vacuole, and instead accumulate smaller organelles. Of the 19 VPL complementation groups, 12 were found to be identical to 12 of 33 VPT comple-mentation groups identified in a separate study. Moreover, the endi mutant and all of the previously reported pep mutants, with the exception of pep4, were found to exhibit a profound vacuolar protein sorting defect, and complementation tests between the PEP, VPL VPT and END] groups demonstrated that there are extensive overlaps between these groups. Collectively, mutants in these four collections define 49 complemen-tation groups required to deliver or retain soluble vacuolar enzymes, including carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) and proteinase A. We have also isolated 462 new mutants that lack normal levels of vacuolar CPY activity. Among these latter mutants, only pep4 mutants were found to be specifically defective in vacuolar zymogen activation. We conclude that there is a large number of gene products required for sorting or retention of vacuolar proteins in yeast, and only a single gene, PEP4, that is essential for activation of CPY and other vacuolar zymogens.},

However, the actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex and there is growing evidence in diverse eukaryotes that F-actin plays a direct role during endocytic internalization. Genetic studies in Saccharomyces cerevisiae have demonstrated that Arp2/3-mediated F-actin assembly is required specifically for the internalization step of endocytosis. Using real-time image analysis, we recently defined a pathway for receptor-mediated endocytosis in budding yeast. Many features of this pathway appear to be conserved widely, indicating that principles derived from our studies in yeast will be directly applicable in more complex eukaryotes. We are pursuing our yeast studies using a combined approach involving image analysis, functional genomics, proteomics and biochemistry. These ongoing studies are providing a broader and deeper understanding of the molecular events of endocytosis, of how forces for actin polymerization are harnessed, and of how steps in the pathway are regulated. Our studies in mammalian cells provide evidence that this pathway is conserved in more complex organisms for endocytic and Golgi trafficking events.},

@article{Liu2006,
abstract = {Endocytosis in budding yeast is thought to occur in several phases. First, the membrane invaginates and then elongates into a tube. A vesicle forms at the end of the tube, eventually pinching off to form a "free" vesicle. Experiments show that actin polymerization is an active participant in the endocytic process, along with a number of membrane-associated proteins. Here we investigate the possible roles of these components in driving vesiculation by constructing a quantitative model of the process beginning at the stage where the membrane invagination has elongated into a tube encased in a sheath of membrane-associated protein. This protein sheath brings about the scission step where the vesicle separates from the tube. When the protein sheath is dynamin, it is commonly assumed that scission is brought about by the constriction of the sheath. Here, we show that an alternative scenario can work as well: The protein sheath acts as a "filter" to effect a phase separation of lipid species. The resulting line tension tends to minimize the interface between the tube region and the vesicle region. Interestingly, large vesicle size can further facilitate the reduction of the interfacial diameter down to a few nanometers, small enough so that thermal fluctuations can fuse the membrane and pinch off the vesicle. To deform the membrane into the tubular vesicle shape, the membrane elastic resistance forces must be balanced by some additional forces that we show can be generated by actin polymerization and/or myosin I. These active forces are shown to be important in successful scission processes as well.},

@article{Heuser1973,
abstract = {When the nerves of isolated frog sartorius muscles were stimulated at 10 Hz, synaptic vesicles in the motor nerve terminals became transiently depleted. This depletion apparently resulted from a redistribution rather than disappearance of synaptic vesicle membrane, since the total amount of membrane comprising these nerve terminals remained constant during stimulation. At 1 min of stimulation, the 30{\%} depletion in synaptic vesicle membrane was nearly balanced by an increase in plasma membrane, suggesting that vesicle membrane rapidly moved to the surface as it might if vesicles released their content of transmitter by exocytosis. After 15 min of stimulation, the 60{\%} depletion of synaptic vesicle membrane was largely balanced by the appearance of numerous irregular membrane-walled cisternae inside the terminals, suggesting that vesicle membrane was retrieved from the surface as cisternae. When muscles were rested after 15 min of stimulation, cisternae disappeared and synaptic vesicles reappeared, suggesting that cisternae divided to form new synaptic vesicles so that the original vesicle membrane was now recycled into new synaptic vesicles. When muscles were soaked in horseradish peroxidase (HRP), this tracerfirst entered the cisternae which formed during stimulation and then entered a large proportion of the synaptic vesicles which reappeared during rest, strengthening the idea that synaptic vesicle membrane added to the surface was retrieved as cisternae which subsequently divided to form new vesicles. When muscles containing HRP in synaptic vesicles were washed to remove extracellular HRP and restimulated, HRP disappeared from vesicles without appearing in the new cisternae formed during the second stimulation, confirming that a one-way recycling of synaptic membrane, from the surface through cisternae to new vesicles, was occurring. Coated vesicles apparently represented the actual mechanism for retrieval of synaptic vesicle membrane from the plasma membrane, because during nerve stimulation they proliferated at regions of the nerve terminals covered by Schwann processes, took up peroxidase, and appeared in various stages of coalescence with cisternae. In contrast, synaptic vesicles did not appear to return directly from the surface to form cisternae, and cisternae themselves never appeared directly connected to the surface. Thus, during stimulation the intracellular compartments of this synapse change shape and take up extracellular protein in a manner which indicates that synaptic vesicle membrane added to the surface during exocytosis is retrieved by coated vesicles and recycled into new synaptic vesicles by way of intermediate cisternae.},

abstract = {Microscopic imaging of fluorescent lipid derivatives is a powerful tool to study membrane organization and lipid trafficking but it is complicated by cellular autofluorescence background and photobleaching of the fluorophore as well as by the difficulty to selectively image membranes stacked on top of each other. Here we describe protocols that strongly alleviate such problems when pyrene-labeled lipids are being used. First, photobleaching of these lipids is virtually eliminated when oxygen is depleted from the medium by using a gentle and simple enzymatic method. Second, an image practically free of cellular autofluorescence contribution can be obtained simply by subtracting from the pyrene image the background image obtained at a slightly different excitation wavelength. This type of background subtraction more properly accounts for the typically uneven distribution of cellular background fluorescence than other, commonly used methods. Third, it is possible to selectively image the pyrene lipids in the plasma membrane by using plasma membrane-specific quencher trinitrophenyl lysophosphatidylethanolamine and image subtraction. Importantly, either the outer or the inner leaflet can be selectively imaged by labeling the cells with pyrene phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylserine, respectively. These protocols should be of considerable help when studying organization of the plasma membrane or intracellular lipid trafficking.},

By direct sequencing of functional candidate genes, we identified homozygous mutations in amphiphysin 2 (BIN1) in three families with autosomal recessive inheritance. Two missense mutations affecting the BAR (Bin1/amphiphysin/RVS167) domain disrupt its membrane tubulation properties in transfected cells, and a partial truncation of the C-terminal SH3 domain abrogates the interaction with DNM2 and its recruitment to the membrane tubules. Our results suggest that mutations in BIN1 cause centronuclear myopathy by interfering with remodeling of T tubules and/or endocytic membranes, and that the functional interaction between BIN1 and DNM2 is necessary for normal muscle function and positioning of nuclei.},

Although the availability of numerous endocytic mutants makes yeast an especially valuable organism for functional analysis of endocytic dynamics, a serious limitation has been the lack of a fluorescent cargo for receptor-mediated endocytosis. We have now synthesized biologically active fluorescent mating-pheromone derivatives and demonstrated that receptor-mediated endocytosis in budding yeast occurs via the clathrin- and actin-mediated endocytosis pathway. We found that endocytic proteins first assemble into patches on the plasma membrane, and then alpha-factor associates with the patches. Internalization occurs next, concomitant with actin assembly at patches. Additionally, endocytic vesicles move toward early endosomes on actin cables. Early endosomes also associate with actin cables, and they actively move toward endocytic sites to capture vesicles being released from the plasma membrane. Thus, endocytic vesicle formation and capture of the newly released vesicles by early endosomes occur in a highly concerted manner, mediated by the actin cytoskeleton.},

@article{Ferguson2009b,
abstract = {Summary
The GTPase dynamin, a key player in endocytic membrane fission, interacts with numerous proteins that regulate actin dynamics and generate/sense membrane curvature. To determine the functional relationship between these proteins and dynamin, we have analyzed endocytic intermediates that accumulate in cells that lack dynamin (derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice). In these cells, actin-nucleating proteins, actin, and BAR domain proteins accumulate at the base of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where they support the growth of dynamic long tubular necks. These results, which we show reflect the sequence of events in wild-type cells, demonstrate a concerted action of these proteins prior to, and independent of, dynamin and emphasize similarities between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Our data also demonstrate that the relationship between dynamin and actin is intimately connected to dynamin's endocytic role and that dynamin terminates a powerful actin- and BAR protein-dependent tubulating activity.},

Here, we show that the F-BAR domain protein pacsin2 is able to associate with actin filaments using the same concave surface employed to bind to membranes, while some other tested N-BAR and F-BAR proteins (endophilin, CIP4 and FCHO2) do not associate with actin.

abstract = {Morphological changes during cell division in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are controlled by cell-cycle regulators. The Pcl-Pho85p kinase complex has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton at least in part through Rvs167p. Rvs167p consists of three domains called BAR, GPA, and SH3. Using a two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that each region of Rvs167p participates in protein-protein interactions: the BAR domain bound the BAR domain of another Rvs167p protein and that of Rvs161p, the GPA region bound Pcl2p, and the SH3 domain bound Abp1p. We identified Rvs167p as a Las17p/Bee1p-interacting protein in a two-hybrid screen and showed that Las17p/Bee1p bound the SH3 domain of Rvs167p. We tested the extent to which the Rvs167p protein domains rescued phenotypes associated with deletion of RVS167: salt sensitivity, random budding, and endocytosis and sporulation defects. The BAR domain was sufficient for full or partial rescue of all rvs167 mutant phenotypes tested but not required for the sporulation defect for which the SH3 domain was also sufficient. Overexpression of Rvs167p inhibits cell growth. The BAR domain was essential for this inhibition and the SH3 domain had only a minor effect. Rvs167p may link the cell cycle regulator Pcl-Pho85p kinase and the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that Rvs167p is activated by phosphorylation in its GPA region by the Pcl-Pho85p kinase. Upon activation, Rvs167p enters a multiprotein complex, making critical contacts in its BAR domain and redundant or minor contacts with its SH3 domain.},

abstract = {The Bin1/amphiphysin/Rvs167 (BAR) domain proteins are a ubiquitous protein family. Genes encoding members of this family have not yet been found in the genomes of prokaryotes, but within eukaryotes, BAR domain proteins are found universally from unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast through to plants, insects, and vertebrates. BAR domain proteins share an N-terminal BAR domain with a high propensity to adopt $\alpha$-helical structure and engage in coiled-coil interactions with other proteins. BAR domain proteins are implicated in processes as fundamental and diverse as fission of synaptic vesicles, cell polarity, endocytosis, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, transcriptional repression, cell-cell fusion, signal transduction, apoptosis, secretory vesicle fusion, excitation-contraction coupling, learning and memory, tissue differentiation, ion flux across membranes, and tumor suppression. What has been lacking is a molecular understanding of the role of the BAR domain protein in each process. The three-dimensional structure of the BAR domain has now been determined and valuable insight has been gained in understanding the interactions of BAR domains with membranes. The cellular roles of BAR domain proteins, characterized over the past decade in cells as distinct as yeasts, neurons, and myocytes, can now be understood in terms of a fundamental molecular function of all BAR domain proteins: to sense membrane curvature, to bind GTPases, and to mold a diversity of cellular membranes.},

abstract = {Actin polymerization essential for endocytic internalization in budding yeast is controlled by four nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) that each exhibits a unique dynamic behavior at endocytic sites. How each NPF functions and is regulated to restrict actin assembly to late stages of endocytic internalization is not known. Quantitative analysis of NPF biochemical activities, and genetic analysis of recruitment and regulatory mechanisms, defined a linear pathway in which protein composition changes at endocytic sites control actin assembly and function. We show that yeast WASP initiates actin assembly at endocytic sites and that this assembly and the recruitment of a yeast WIP-like protein by WASP recruit a type I myosin with both NPF and motor activities. Importantly, type I myosin motor and NPF activities are separable, and both contribute to endocytic coat inward movement, which likely represents membrane invagination. These results reveal a mechanism in which actin nucleation and myosin motor activity cooperate to promote endocytic internalization.},

abstract = {SH3 domains are modules of 50-70 amino acids that promote interactions among proteins, often participating in the assembly of large dynamic complexes. These domains bind to peptide ligands, which usually contain a core Pro-X-X-Pro (PXXP) sequence. Here we identify a class of SH3 domains that bind to ubiquitin. The yeast endocytic protein Sla1, as well as the mammalian proteins CIN85 and amphiphysin, carry ubiquitin-binding SH3 domains. Ubiquitin and peptide ligands bind to the same hydrophobic groove on the SH3 domain surface, and ubiquitin and a PXXP-containing protein fragment compete for binding to SH3 domains. We conclude that a subset of SH3 domains constitutes a distinct type of ubiquitin-binding domain and that ubiquitin binding can negatively regulate interaction of SH3 domains with canonical proline-rich ligands.},

abstract = {During clathrin-mediated endocytosis, branched actin polymerization nucleated by the Arp2/3 complex provides force needed to drive vesicle internalization. Las17 (yeast WASp) is the strongest activator of the Arp2/3 complex in yeast cells; it is not autoinhibited and arrives to endocytic sites 20 s before actin polymerization begins. It is unclear how Las17 is kept inactive for 20 s at endocytic sites, thus restricting actin polymerization to late stages of endocytosis. In this paper, we demonstrate that Las17 is part of a large and biochemically stable complex with Sla1, a clathrin adaptor that inhibits Las17 activity. The interaction is direct, multivalent, and strong, and was mapped to novel Las17 polyproline motifs that are simultaneously class I and class II. In vitro pyrene-actin polymerization assays established that Sla1 inhibition of Las17 activity depends on the class I/II Las17 polyproline motifs and is based on competition between Sla1 and monomeric actin for binding to Las17. Furthermore, live-cell imaging showed the interaction with Sla1 is important for normal Las17 recruitment to endocytic sites, inhibition during the initial 20 s, and efficient endocytosis. These results advance our understanding of the regulation of actin polymerization in endocytosis.},

abstract = {Here, we report on a novel PCR targeting-based strategy called ‘PCR duplication' that enables targeted duplications of genomic regions in the yeast genome using a simple PCR-based approach. To demonstrate its application we first duplicated the promoter of the FAR1 gene in yeast and simultaneously inserted a GFP downstream of it. This created a reporter for promoter activity while leaving the FAR1 gene fully intact. In another experiment, we used PCR duplication to increase the dosage of a gene in a discrete manner, from 1× to 2x. Using TUB4, the gene encoding for the yeast $\gamma$-tubulin, we validated that this led to corresponding increases in the levels of mRNA and protein. PCR duplication is an easy one-step procedure that can be adapted in different ways to permit rapid, disturbance-free investigation of various genomic regulatory elements without the need for ex vivo cloning.},

abstract = {Dual colour total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy is a powerful tool for decoding the molecular dynamics of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). Typically, the recruitment of a fluorescent protein-tagged endocytic protein was referenced to the disappearance of spot-like clathrin-coated structure (CCS), but the precision of spot-like CCS disappearance as a marker for canonical CME remained unknown. Here we have used an imaging assay based on total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy to detect scission events with a resolution of ∼ 2 s. We found that scission events engulfed comparable amounts of transferrin receptor cargo at CCSs of different sizes and CCS did not always disappear following scission. We measured the recruitment dynamics of 34 types of endocytic protein to scission events: Abp1, ACK1, amphiphysin1, APPL1, Arp3, BIN1, CALM, CIP4, clathrin light chain (Clc), cofilin, coronin1B, cortactin, dynamin1/2, endophilin2, Eps15, Eps8, epsin2, FBP17, FCHo1/2, GAK, Hip1R, lifeAct, mu2 subunit of the AP2 complex, myosin1E, myosin6, NECAP, N-WASP, OCRL1, Rab5, SNX9, synaptojanin2$\beta$1, and syndapin2. For each protein we aligned ∼ 1,000 recruitment profiles to their respective scission events and constructed characteristic "recruitment signatures" that were grouped, as for yeast, to reveal the modular organization of mammalian CME. A detailed analysis revealed the unanticipated recruitment dynamics of SNX9, FBP17, and CIP4 and showed that the same set of proteins was recruited, in the same order, to scission events at CCSs of different sizes and lifetimes. Collectively these data reveal the fine-grained temporal structure of CME and suggest a simplified canonical model of mammalian CME in which the same core mechanism of CME, involving actin, operates at CCSs of diverse sizes and lifetimes.},

Dynamin fission reaction is strictly dependent on GTP hydrolysis, but how fission is mediated is still debated (Antonny et al., 2016): GTP energy could be spent in membrane constriction required for fission, or in disassembly of the dynamin polymer to trigger fission. To follow dynamin GTP hydrolysis at endocytic pits, we generated a conformation-specific nanobody called dynab, that binds preferentially to the GTP hydrolytic state of dynamin-1. Dynab allowed us to follow the GTPase activity of dynamin-1 in real-time. We show that in fibroblasts, dynamin GTP hydrolysis occurs as stochastic bursts, which are randomly distributed relatively to the peak of dynamin assembly. Thus, dynamin disassembly is not coupled to GTPase activity, supporting that the GTP energy is primarily spent in constriction.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Amphiphysins, members of the BAR (Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvsp) protein super family, have been postulated to play a key role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of synaptic vesicles (SVs). This review focuses on recent genetic studies of the role of amphiphysins in SV recycling and membrane morphogenesis. In the mouse, brain-specific amphiphysin I and II regulate, but are not essential for, SV recycling. The role of this regulation appears important, as mice deficient in these proteins have seizures and are deficient in learning and memory. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, amphiphysin is found in muscles and is enriched at postsynaptic membranes of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs); however, it does not play a role in SV recycling. Rather, amphiphysin in fly muscles appears to regulate the organization and structure of the muscle T-tubule system and possibly the subsynaptic reticulum. Amphiphysin is also involved in membrane organization in both neurons and non-neuronal cells in Drosophila. These studies reveal pleiotropic functions for amphiphysins in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and the regulation of membrane dynamics, perhaps through the actin cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {BAR (Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs) domains and amphipathic $\alpha$-helices (AHs) are believed to be sensors of membrane curvature thus facilitating the assembly of protein complexes on curved membranes. Here, we used quantitative fluorescence microscopy to compare the binding of both motifs on single nanosized liposomes of different diameters and therefore membrane curvature. Characterization of members of the three BAR domain families showed surprisingly that the crescent-shaped BAR dimer with its positively charged concave face is not able to sense membrane curvature. Mutagenesis on BAR domains showed that membrane curvature sensing critically depends on the N-terminal AH and furthermore that BAR domains sense membrane curvature through hydrophobic insertion in lipid packing defects and not through electrostatics. Consequently, amphipathic motifs, such as AHs, that are often associated with BAR domains emerge as an important means for a protein to sense membrane curvature. Measurements on single liposomes allowed us to document heterogeneous binding behaviour within the ensemble and quantify the influence of liposome polydispersity on bulk membrane curvature sensing experiments. The latter results suggest that bulk liposome-binding experiments should be interpreted with great caution.},

Changes in membrane surface area, resulting from fusion and fission of membrane vesicles, can be followed by monitoring the corresponding proportional changes in membrane capacitance. Using the cell-attached configuration of the patch-clamp techniques we were able to resolve the elementary processes of endo- and exocytosis in yeast protoplasts at high temporal and spatial resolution. Spontaneous capacitance changes were predominantly in the range of 0.2–1 fF which translates to vesicle diameters of 90–200 nm. The size distribution revealed that endocytotic vesicles with a median at about 132 nm were smaller than exocytotic vesicles with a median at 155 nm. In energized and metabolizing protoplasts, endo- and exocytotic events occurred at frequencies of 1.6 and 2.7 events per minute, respectively. Even though these numbers appear very low, they are in good agreement with the observed growth rate of yeast cells and protoplasts.},

After almost 25 years of research, a wide variety of data from various techniques has been acquired on the mechanism by which dynamin breaks membranes. However, the literature may sometimes sound confusing, and the primary goal of this review will be to provide a stepping stone towards a potential consensus on how dynamin may work. I will then discuss the most recent findings in light of previous work, and the future possible lines of research in the field of dynamin.},

abstract = {In yeast, nutrient starvation leads to entry into stationary phase. Mutants that do not respond properly to starvation conditons have been isolated in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Among them the rvs161 mutant (RVS for Reduced Viability upon Starvation) is sensitive to carbon, nitrogen and sulphur starvation. When these nutrients are depleted in the medium, mutant cells show cellular viability loss with morphological changes. The mutation rvs161-1 is very pleiotropic, and besides the defects in stationary phase entry, the mutant strain presents other alterations: sensitivity to high salt concentrations, hypersensitivity to amino acid analogs, no growth on lactate or acetate medium. The addition of salts or amino acid analogs leads to the same morphological defects observed in starved cells, suggesting that the gene could be implicated mainly in the control of cellular viability. The gene RVS161 was cloned; it codes for a 30,252 daltons protein. No homology was detected with the proteins contained in the databases. Moreover, Southern analysis revealed the presence of other sequences homologous to the RVS161 gene in the yeast genome.},

abstract = {Clathrin is involved in selective protein transport at the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. To further understand the molecular mechanisms underlying clathrin-mediated protein transport pathways, we initiated a genetic screen for mutations that display synthetic growth defects when combined with a temperature-sensitive allele of the clathrin heavy chain gene (chc1-521) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Mutations, when present in cells with wild-type clathrin, were analyzed for effects on mating pheromone alpha-factor precursor maturation and sorting of the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y as measures of protein sorting at the yeast trans-Golgi network (TGN) compartment. By these criteria, two classes of mutants were obtained, those with and those without defects in protein sorting at the TGN. One mutant with unaltered protein sorting at the TGN contains a mutation in PTC1, a type 2c serine/threonine phosphatase with widespread influences. The collection of mutants displaying TGN sorting defects includes members with mutations in previously identified vacuolar protein sorting genes (VPS), including the dynamin family member VPS1. Striking genetic interactions were observed by combining temperature-sensitive alleles of CHC1 and VPS1, supporting the model that Vps1p is involved in clathrin-mediated vesicle formation at the TGN. Also in the spectrum of mutants with TGN sorting defects are isolates with mutations in the following: RIC1, encoding a product originally proposed to participate in ribosome biogenesis; LUV1, encoding a product potentially involved in vacuole and microtubule organization; and INP53, encoding a synaptojanin-like inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase. Disruption of INP53, but not the related INP51 and INP52 genes, resulted in alpha-factor maturation defects and exacerbated alpha-factor maturation defects when combined with chc1-521. Our findings implicate a wide variety of proteins in clathrin-dependent processes and provide evidence for the selective involvement of Inp53p in clathrin-mediated protein sorting at the TGN.},

abstract = {Lipids and several specialized proteins are thought to be able to sense the curvature of membranes (MC). Here we used quantitative fluorescence microscopy to measure curvature-selective binding of amphipathic motifs on single liposomes 50–700 nm in diameter. Our results revealed that sensing is predominantly mediated by a higher density of binding sites on curved membranes instead of higher affinity. We proposed a model based on curvature-induced defects in lipid packing that related these findings to lipid sorting and accurately predicted the existence of a new ubiquitous class of curvature sensors: membrane-anchored proteins. The fact that unrelated structural motifs such as $\alpha$-helices and alkyl chains sense MC led us to propose that MC sensing is a generic property of curved membranes rather than a property of the anchoring molecules. We therefore anticipate that MC will promote the redistribution of proteins that are anchored in membranes through other types of hydrophobic moieties.},

Here, by combining this approach with correlative light and electron microscopy, we address the role of clathrin in this process. During endocytosis, clathrin forms a cage-like coat around the membrane and associated protein components. There is growing evidence that clathrin does not determine the membrane morphology of the invagination but rather modulates the progression of endocytosis. We investigate how the deletion of clathrin heavy chain impairs the dynamics and the morphology of the endocytic membrane in budding yeast. Our results show that clathrin is not required for elongating or shaping the endocytic membrane invagination. Instead, we find that clathrin contributes to the regularity of vesicle scission and thereby to controlling vesicle size.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Here, we present the crystal structure of this novel actin-bundling domain revealing a coiled-coil domain that self-associates into a 180 {\AA}-long zeppelin-shaped dimer. Sedimentation velocity experiments confirm the presence of a single molecular species of twice the molecular weight of the monomer in solution. Mutagenesis of conserved basic residues at the extreme ends of the dimer abrogated actin bundling in vitro and filopodia formation in vivo, demonstrating that IMD-mediated actin bundling is required for IRSp53-induced filopodia formation. This study promotes an expanded view of IRSp53 as an actin regulator that integrates scaffolding and effector functions.},

Vps1p is most similar to mammalian dynamin and the Drosophila Shibire protein, both of which have been shown to play a role in an early step of endocytosis. To identify proteins that interact with Vps1p, a genetic screen was designed to isolate multicopy suppressors of dominant-negative vps1 mutations. One such suppressor, MVP1, that exhibits genetic interaction with VPS1 and is itself required for vacuolar protein sorting has been isolated. Overproduction of Mvp1p will suppress several dominant alleles of VPS1, and suppression is dependent on the presence of wild-type Vps1p. MVP1 encodes a 59-kDa hydrophilic protein, Mvp1p, which appears to colocalize with Vps1p in vps1d and vps27 delta yeast cells.

Using electron paramagnetic resonance, we find that vesicle binding of the N-BAR protein amphiphysin is predominantly mediated by the shallow insertion of amphipathic N-terminal helices. In contrast, the interaction with tubes involves deeply inserted N-terminal helices together with the concave surface of the BAR domain, which acts as a scaffold. Combined with the observed concentration dependence of tubulation and BAR domain scaffolding, the data indicate that initial membrane deformations and vesicle binding are mediated by insertion of amphipathic helical wedges, while tubulation requires high protein densities at which oligomeric BAR domain scaffolds form. In addition, we identify a pocket of residues on the concave surface of the BAR domain that insert deeply into tube membrane. Interestingly, this pocket harbors a number of disease mutants in the homologous amphiphysin 2.},

abstract = {We have screened a large tomato EST database against the Arabidopsis genomic sequence and report here the identification of a set of 1025 genes (referred to as a conserved ortholog set, or COS markers) that are single or low copy in both genomes (as determined by computational screens and DNA gel blot hybridization) and that have remained relatively stable in sequence since the early radiation of dicotyledonous plants. These genes were annotated, and a large portion could be assigned to putative functional categories associated with basic metabolic processes, such as energy-generating processes and the biosynthesis and degradation of cellular building blocks. We further demonstrate, through computational screens (e.g., against a Medicago truncatula database) and direct hybridization on genomic DNA of diverse plant species, that these COS markers also are conserved in the genomes of other plant families. Finally, we show that this gene set can be used for comparative mapping studies between highly divergent genomes such as those of tomato and Arabidopsis. This set of COS markers, identified computationally and experimentally, may further studies on comparative genomes and phylogenetics and elucidate the nature of genes conserved throughout plant evolution.},

abstract = {During endocytosis, actin-dependent forces are needed to oppose internal turgor pressure for invagination of the plasma membrane. Live-cell imaging shows that addition of sorbitol to the medium significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process and rescues defects of endocytic mutants in fission yeast., Yeast and other walled cells possess high internal turgor pressure that allows them to grow and survive in the environment. This turgor pressure, however, may oppose the invagination of the plasma membrane needed for endocytosis. Here we study the effects of turgor pressure on endocytosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by time-lapse imaging of individual endocytic sites. Decreasing effective turgor pressure by addition of sorbitol to the media significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process before actin assembly and membrane ingression but does not affect the velocity or depth of ingression of the endocytic pit in wild-type cells. Sorbitol also rescues endocytic ingression defects of certain endocytic mutants and of cells treated with a low dose of the actin inhibitor latrunculin A. Endocytosis proceeds after removal of the cell wall, suggesting that the cell wall does not contribute mechanically to this process. These studies suggest that endocytosis is governed by a mechanical balance between local actin-dependent inward forces and opposing forces from high internal turgor pressure on the plasma membrane.},

To determine the functional relationship between these proteins and dynamin, we have analyzed endocytic intermediates that accumulate in cells that lack dynamin (derived from dynamin 1 and 2 double conditional knockout mice). In these cells, actin-nucleating proteins, actin, and BAR domain proteins accumulate at the base of arrested endocytic clathrin-coated pits, where they support the growth of dynamic long tubular necks. These results, which we show reflect the sequence of events in wild-type cells, demonstrate a concerted action of these proteins prior to, and independent of, dynamin and emphasize similarities between clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and higher eukaryotes. Our data also demonstrate that the relationship between dynamin and actin is intimately connected to dynamin's endocytic role and that dynamin terminates a powerful actin- and BAR protein-dependent tubulating activity.},

To assess the function of these different domains we have expressed recombinant Rvs proteins in rvs mutant strains. Phenotype analysis has shown that the RVS and SH3 domains are necessary for phenotypical complementation, whereas the GPA domain is not. Moreover, we have demonstrated that the RVS domains from Rvs161p and Rvs167p have distinct roles, and that the SH3 domain needs the specific RVS domain of Rvs167p to function.

abstract = {Recently, a pathway involving the highly choreographed recruitment of endocytic proteins to sites of clathrin/actin-mediated endocytosis has been revealed in budding yeast. Here, we investigated possible roles for candidate disassembly factors in regulation of the dynamics of the endocytic coat proteins Sla2p, Ent1p, Ent2p, Sla1p, Pan1p and End3p, each of which has mammalian homologues. Live cell imaging analysis revealed that in addition to the synaptojanin, Sjl2p, the Ark1p and Prk1p protein kinases, the putative Arf GTPase-activating protein, Gts1p and the Arf GTPase-interacting protein, Lsb5p, also arrive at endocytic sites late in the internalization pathway, consistent with roles in coat disassembly. Analysis of coat dynamics in various mutant backgrounds revealed that multiple pathways, including the ones mediated by an Arf guanosine triphosphatase and a synaptojanin, facilitate efficient disassembly of different endocytic coat proteins. In total, at least four separate processes are important for disassembly of endocytic complexes and efficient downstream trafficking of endocytic cargo.},

abstract = {Yeast produce two classes of secretory vesicles (SVs) that differ in both density and cargo protein content. In late-acting secretory mutants (e.g. snc1(ala43) and sec6-4), both low- (LDSV) and high-density (HDSV) classes of vesicles accumulate at restrictive temperatures. Here, we have found that disruptions in the genes encoding a dynamin-related protein (VPS1) or clathrin heavy chain (CHC1) abolish HDSV production, yielding LDSVs that contain all secreted cargos. Interestingly, disruption of the PEP12 gene, which encodes the t-SNARE that mediates all Golgi to pre-vacuolar compartment (PVC) transport, also abolishes HDSV production. In contrast, deletions in genes that selectively confer vacuolar hydrolase sorting to the PVC or protein transport to the vacuole (i.e. VPS34 and VAM3, respectively) have no effect. Thus, one branch of the secretory pathway in yeast involves an intermediate sorting compartment and has a specific requirement for clathrin and a dynamin-related protein in SV biogenesis.},

abstract = {The Hof1 protein (Homologue of Fifteen) regulates formation of the primary septum during cytokinesis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas the orthologous Cdc15 protein in fission yeast regulates the actomyosin ring by using its F-BAR domain to recruit actin nucleators to the cleavage site. Here we show that budding yeast Hof1 also contributes to actin ring assembly in parallel with the Rvs167 protein. Simultaneous deletion of the HOF1 and RVS167 genes is lethal, and cells fail to assemble the actomyosin ring as they progress through mitosis. Although Hof1 and Rvs167 are not orthologues, they both share an analogous structure, with an F-BAR or BAR domain at the amino terminus, capable of inducing membrane curvature, and SH3 domains at the carboxyl terminus that bind to specific proline-rich targets. The SH3 domain of Rvs167 becomes essential for assembly of the actomyosin ring in cells lacking Hof1, suggesting that it helps to recruit a regulator of the actin cytoskeleton. This new function of Rvs167 appears to be independent of its known role as a regulator of the Arp2/3 actin nucleator, as actin ring assembly is not abolished by the simultaneous inactivation of Hof1 and Arp2/3. Instead we find that recruitment to the bud-neck of the Iqg1 actin regulator is defective in cells lacking Hof1 and Rvs167, though future studies will be needed to determine if this reflects a direct interaction between these factors. The redundant role of Hof1 in actin ring assembly suggests that the mechanism of actin ring assembly has been conserved to a greater extent across evolution than anticipated previously.},

abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that the function of the large GTPase dynamin in endocytosis in mammalian cells may comprise a modulation of actin cytoskeleton. The role of dynamin in actin cytoskeleton organization in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has remained undefined. In this report, we found that one of the yeast dynamin-related proteins, Vps1p, is required for normal actin cytoskeleton organization. At both permissive and non-permissive temperatures, the vps1 mutants exhibited various degrees of phenotypes commonly associated with actin cytoskeleton defects: depolarized and aggregated actin structures, hypersensitivity to the actin cytoskeleton toxin latrunculin-A, randomized bud site selection and chitin deposition, and impaired efficiency in the internalization of membrane receptors. Over-expression of the GTPase mutants of vps1 also led to actin abnormalities. Consistent with these actin-related defects, Vps1p was found to interact physically, and partially co-localize, with the actin-regulatory protein Sla1p. The normal cellular localization of Sla1p required Vps1p and could be altered by over-expression of a region of Vps1p that was involved in the interaction with Sla1p. The same region also promoted mis-sorting of the vacuolar protein carboxypeptidase Y upon over-expression. These findings suggest that the functions of the dynamin-related protein Vps1p in actin cytoskeleton dynamics and vacuolar protein sorting are probably related to each other.},

Genes encoding members of this family have not yet been found in the genomes of prokaryotes, but within eukaryotes, BAR domain proteins are found universally from unicellular eukaryotes such as yeast through to plants, insects, and vertebrates. BAR domain proteins share an N-terminal BAR domain with a high propensity to adopt $\alpha$-helical structure and engage in coiled-coil interactions with other proteins. BAR domain proteins are implicated in processes as fundamental and diverse as fission of synaptic vesicles, cell polarity, endocytosis, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, transcriptional repression, cell-cell fusion, signal transduction, apoptosis, secretory vesicle fusion, excitation-contraction coupling, learning and memory, tissue differentiation, ion flux across membranes, and tumor suppression. What has been lacking is a molecular understanding of the role of the BAR domain protein in each process. The three-dimensional structure of the BAR domain has now been determined and valuable insight has been gained in understanding the interactions of BAR domains with membranes. The cellular roles of BAR domain proteins, characterized over the past decade in cells as distinct as yeasts, neurons, and myocytes, can now be understood in terms of a fundamental molecular function of all BAR domain proteins: to sense membrane curvature, to bind GTPases, and to mold a diversity of cellular membranes.},

abstract = {Amphiphysin I is a 128 kD protein highly concentrated in nerve terminals, where it has a putative role in endocytosis. It is a dominant autoantigen in patients with stiff-man syndrome associated with breast cancer, as well as in other paraneoplastic autoimmune neurological disorders. To elucidate the connection between amphiphysin I autoimmunity and cancer, we investigated its expression in breast cancer tissue. We report that amphiphysin I was expressed as two isoforms of 128 and 108 kD in the breast cancer of a patient with anti-amphiphysin I antibodies and paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathy. Amphiphysin I was also detectable at variable levels in several other human breast cancer tissues and cell lines and at low levels in normal mammary tissue and a variety of other non-neuronal tissues. The predominant amphiphysin I isoform expressed outside the brain in humans is the 108 kD isoform which represents an alternatively spliced variant of neuronal amphiphysin I missing a 42 amino acid insert. Our study suggests a link between amphiphysin I expression in cancer and amphiphysin I autoimmunity. The enhanced expression of amphiphysin I in some forms of cancer supports the hypothesis that amphiphysin family members may play a role in the biology of cancer cells.},

abstract = {Cortical actin patches are dynamic structures required for endocytosis in yeast [1]. Recent studies have shown that components of cortical patches localize to the plasma membrane in a precisely orchestrated manner, and their movements at and away from the plasma membrane may define the endocytic membrane invagination and vesicle scission events, respectively [2]. Here, through live-cell imaging, we analyze the dynamics of the highly conserved class I unconventional myosin, Myo5, which also localizes to cortical patches and is known to be involved in endocytosis and actin nucleation 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. Myo5 exhibits a pattern of dynamic localization different from all cortical patch components analyzed to date. Myo5 associates with cortical patches only transiently and remains stationary during its brief cortical lifespan. The peak of Myo5 association with cortical patches immediately precedes the fast movement of Arp2/3 complex-associated structures away from the plasma membrane, thus correlating precisely with the proposed vesicle scission event. To further test the role of Myo5, we generated a temperature-sensitive mutant myo5 allele. In the myo5 mutant cells, Myo5 exhibits a significantly extended cortical lifespan as a result of a general impairment of Myo5 function, and Arp2 patches exhibit an extended slow-movement phase prior to the fast movement toward the cell interior. The myo5 mutant cells are defective in fluid-phase endocytosis and exhibit an increased number of invaginations on the membrane. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the myosin I motor protein facilitates the membrane fusion/vesicle scission event of endocytosis.},

Even in its simplest form, endocytosis involves a large number of proteins with often redundant functions that are organized into a microscopic force-producing “machine”. Knowing how much force is needed to induce a membrane invagination is essential to understand how this endocytic machine may operate. We show that experimental membrane shapes are well described theoretically by a thin sheet elastic model including a difference of pressure across the membrane due to turgor. This allows us to integrate the different contributions that shape the membrane, and to compute the forces opposing membrane deformation. This calculation provides an estimate of the pulling force that must be generated by the actin machinery in yeast. We also identify a membrane instability that could lead to vesicle budding.},

Rvs161p and Rvs167p have been shown to interact in the two-hybrid system, but their localization in the cell may be different thus raising the question whether the interaction is physiologically relevant. Here we demonstrate that the two proteins function together in vivo. We find that the steady state level of Rvs167p is strongly reduced in an rvs161$\Delta$ strain. Similarly, the level of Rvs161p is strongly reduced in an rvs167$\Delta$ strain. We demonstrate that these reduced protein levels at steady state are due to a decreased stability of either Rvs protein in the absence of the other protein. Furthermore, we find that the amount and ratio of Rvs161p and Rvs167p are critical parameters for receptor-mediated endocytosis. In addition, by using the two-hybrid system we show that the interaction of Rvs167p with actin is not abolished in anabp1$\Delta$ strain suggesting that Abp1p is not essential for this interaction.},

AtxA caused changes in the dynamics of vesicle formation and scission from the plasma membrane in a phospholipase activity dependent manner. Our data, based on synthetic dosage lethality screen and the analysis of the dynamics of sites of endocytosis, indicate that AtxA impairs the activity of amphiphysin.ConclusionsWe identified amphiphysin and endocytosis as the target of AtxA intracellular activity. We propose that AtxA reduces endocytosis following a mechanism of action which includes both a specific protein–protein interaction and enzymatic activity, and which is applicable to yeast and mammalian cells. Knowing how neurotoxic phospholipases A2 work can open new ways to regulate endocytosis.},

In contrast, protein coats and their associated accessory proteins drive membrane bending using a variety of interdependent physical mechanisms. We survey the energy costs and drivers involved in membrane curvature, and draw a contrast between the stochastic contributions of molecular crowding and the deterministic assembly of protein coats. These basic principles also apply to other cellular examples of membrane bending events, including important disease-related problems such as viral egress.},

The classical technique to measure turgor in a single cell, the pressure probe, is intrusive and cannot be applied to small cells. In order to overcome these limitations, we developed a method that combines quantification of topography, nanoindentation force measurements, and an interpretation using a published mechanical model for the pointlike loading of thin elastic shells. We used atomic force microscopy to estimate the elastic properties of the cell wall and turgor pressure from a single force-depth curve. We applied this method to onion epidermal peels and quantified the response to changes in osmolality of the bathing solution. Overall our approach is accessible and enables a straightforward estimation of the hydrostatic pressure inside a walled cell.},

abstract = {We have used a lipophilic styryl dye, N-(3-triethylammoniumpropyl)-4- (p-diethylaminophenyl-hexatrienyl) pyridinium dibromide (FM 4-64), as a vital stain to follow bulk membrane-internalization and transport to the vacuole in yeast. After treatment for 60 min at 30 degrees C, FM 4-64 stained the vacuole membrane (ring staining pattern). FM 4-64 did not appear to reach the vacuole by passive diffusion because at 0 degree C it exclusively stained the plasma membrane (PM). The PM staining decreased after warming cells to 25 degrees C and small punctate structures became apparent in the cytoplasm within 5-10 min. After an additional 20-40 min, the PM and cytoplasmic punctate staining disappeared concomitant with staining of the vacuolar membrane. Under steady state conditions, FM 4-64 staining was specific for vacuolar membranes; other membrane structures were not stained. The dye served as a sensitive reporter of vacuolar dynamics, detecting such events as segregation structure formation during mitosis, vacuole fission/fusion events, and vacuolar morphology in different classes of vacuolar protein sorting (vps) mutants. A particularly striking pattern was observed in class E mutants (e.g., vps27) where 500-700 nm organelles (presumptive prevacuolar compartments) were intensely stained with FM 4-64 while the vacuole membrane was weakly fluorescent. Internalization of FM 4-64 at 15 degrees C delayed vacuolar labeling and trapped FM 4-64 in cytoplasmic intermediates between the PM and the vacuole. The intermediate structures in the cytoplasm are likely to be endosomes as their staining was temperature, time, and energy dependent. Interestingly, unlike Lucifer yellow uptake, vacuolar labeling by FM 4-64 was not blocked in sec18, sec14, end3, and end4 mutants, but was blocked in sec1 mutant cells. Finally, using permeabilized yeast spheroplasts to reconstitute FM 4-64 transport, we found that delivery of FM 4-64 from the endosome-like intermediate compartment (labeled at 15 degrees C) to the vacuole was ATP and cytosol dependent. Thus, we show that FM 4-64 is a new vital stain for the vacuolar membrane, a marker for endocytic intermediates, and a fluor for detecting endosome to vacuole membrane transport in vitro.},

A critical challenge is to understand the actions of these proteins in cells, especially in settings where multiple regulators are present. In a systematic study of the sequential multicomponent actin assembly processes that accompany endocytosis in yeast, we examined and compared the roles of WASp, two type-I myosins, and two other Arp2/3 activators, along with that of coronin, which is a proposed inhibitor of Arp2/3. Quantitative analysis of high-speed fluorescence imaging revealed individual functions for the regulators, manifested in part by novel phenotypes. We conclude that Arp2/3 regulators have distinct and overlapping roles in the processes of actin assembly that drive endocytosis in yeast. The formation of the endocytic actin patch, the creation of the endocytic vesicle, and the movement of the vesicle into the cytoplasm display distinct dependencies on different Arp2/3 regulators. Knowledge of these roles provides insight into the in vivo relevance of the dendritic nucleation model for actin assembly.},

Calmodulin performs essential roles in mitosis, through its regulation of Nuf1p/Spc110p, a component of the spindle pole body, and in bud growth, by binding Myo2p, an unconventional class V myosin required for polarized secretion. Surprisingly, mutant calmodulins that fail to bind Ca2+ can perform these essential functions. Calmodulin is also required for endocytosis in yeast and participates in Ca2+-dependent, stress-activated signaling pathways through its regulation of a protein phosphatase, calcineurin, and the protein kinases, Cmk1p and Cmk2p. Thus, calmodulin performs important physiological functions in yeast cells in both its Ca2+-bound and Ca2+-free form.},

abstract = {Five points are discussed regarding the vesicular structure isolated by fractionation techniques from the brain and liver of the guinea pig. 1. One type of vesicle, fixed by OsO(4) and shown in thin sections, is identified with the coated vesicle that has been observed in many varieties of tissues. 2. The vesicle contained in a spherical polygonal "basketwork" shown by the negative-staining techniques is identical with the coated vesicle shown in sections. 3. Despite minute observation of this basketwork we could not confirm the existence of "hairlike projections" extending from the convex cytoplasmic surface of the vesicle. We are inclined to believe, therefore, that the hairlike projections are actually the superimposed visual images of the regular hexagons and pentagons of the network composing the basketwork. 4. We repeat the hypothesis originally advanced by Roth and Porter (1) that the "coating" of the coated vesicle plays a role in the mechanism of the infolding and fission of the membrane; we suggest that these events are caused by the transformation of the regular hexagons (of the coating) into regular pentagons. 5. Finally, we make a suggestion as to the nature of those vesicles which have on their surface subparticles which look like "elementary particles (2)."},

Anti-actin antibodies primarily labeled dense, patchlike cortical structures and cytoplasmic cables. This localization recapitulates results obtained with immunofluorescence light microscopy, but at much higher resolution. Immuno-EM double-labeling experiments were conducted with antibodies to actin together with antibodies to the actin binding proteins Abp1p and cofilin. As expected from immunofluorescence experiments, Abp1p, cofilin, and actin colocalized in immuno-EM to the dense patchlike structures but not to the cables. In this way, we can unambiguously identify the patches as the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The cortical actin patches were observed to be associated with the cell surface via an invagination of plasma membrane. This novel cortical cytoskeleton-plasma membrane interface appears to consist of a fingerlike invagination of plasma membrane around which actin filaments and actin binding proteins are organized. We propose a possible role for this unique cortical structure in wall growth and osmotic regulation.},

abstract = {Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) domain proteins are central regulators of many cellular processes involving membrane dynamics. BAR domains sculpt phosphoinositide-rich membranes to generate membrane protrusions or invaginations. Here, we report that, in addition to regulating membrane geometry, BAR domains can generate extremely stable lipid microdomains by "freezing" phosphoinositide dynamics. This is a general feature of BAR domains, because the yeast endocytic BAR and Fes/CIP4 homology BAR (F-BAR) domains, the inverse BAR domain of Pinkbar, and the eisosomal BAR protein Lsp1 induced phosphoinositide clustering and halted lipid diffusion, despite differences in mechanisms of membrane interactions. Lsp1 displays comparable low diffusion rates invitro and invivo, suggesting that BAR domain proteins also generate stable phosphoinositide microdomains in cells. These results uncover a conserved role for BAR superfamily proteins in regulating lipid dynamics within membranes. Stable microdomains induced by BAR domain scaffolds and specific lipids can generate phase boundaries and diffusion barriers, which may have profound impacts on diverse cellular processes},

abstract = {Vrp1p (yeast WIP) forms a protein complex with Las17p (yeast WASP), however the physiological significance of the interaction has not been fully characterized. Vrp1p residues, (788)MPKPR(792) are essential for Vrp1p-Las17p interaction. While C-Vrp1p(364-817) complements all the defects of the vrp1$\Delta$ strain, C-Vrp1p(364-817)(5A) ((788)AAAAA(792)) does not complement any of the defects, due to its inability to localize to cortical patches. Targeting C-Vrp1p(364-817)(5A) to membranes using CAAX motif (C-Vrp1p(364-817)(5A)-CAAX) rescued the growth and endocytosis defect but not the actin patch polarization defect of vrp1$\Delta$. Vrp1p can localize to cortical patches, either by binding to Las17p through LBD (Las17 Binding Domain, Vrp1p(760-817)) or independent of Las17p through residues in N-Vrp1p(1-364). Unlike Vrp1p, Vrp1p(5A) localizes poorly to cortical patches and complements all the defects of vrp1$\Delta$ strain except actin patch polarization at elevated temperature. N-Vrp1p(1-364) complements all the defects of vrp1$\Delta$ strain except the actin patch polarization defect while N-Vrp1p(1-364)-LBD fusion protein complements all the defects. Thus our results show that while both Vrp1p and Las17p are essential for many cellular processes, the two proteins do not necessarily have to bind to each other to carry out these cellular functions. However, Las17p-Vrp1p interaction is essential for actin patch polarization at elevated temperature.},

abstract = {Amphiphysin I is an SH3 domain-containing neuronal protein, enriched in axon terminals, which was reported to act as a physiological binding partner for dynamin I in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Rvs167 and Rvs161, the yeast homologs of amphiphysin I, have been implicated in endocytosis, actin function, and cell polarity. Now we have explored the possibility that amphiphysin I also may have a role in actin dynamics and cell polarity by testing the effect of amphiphysin I suppression on neurite outgrowth. Freshly plated hippocampal neurons were exposed to antisense oligonucleotides via a new delivery system based on a polycationic amphipathic polymer, PS980. Western blot analysis revealed that amphiphysin I levels steadily increased with neuronal differentiation, whereas in antisense-treated cultures amphiphysin I levels were reduced to approximately 10{\%} of control levels at 48 hr. Concomitantly, a collapse of growth cones and a severe inhibition of neurite outgrowth and axon formation were observed. A similar effect was observed previously after dynamin I suppression in the same culture system (). We also have found that amphiphysin I and dynamin I colocalize in developing neurons at all developmental stages and that a pool of both proteins is colocalized with actin patches at the leading edge of growth cones. Our findings suggest a conserved role of the amphiphysin protein family in the dynamics of the cortical cell cytoskeleton and provide new evidence for a close functional link between amphiphysin I and dynamin I.},

abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells select bud  sites according to one of two predetermined patterns.  MATa and MAT$\alpha$ cells bud in an axial pattern, and  MATa/$\alpha$ cells bud in a bipolar pattern. These budding  patterns are thought to depend on the placement of  spatial cues at specific sites in the cell cortex. Because  cytoskeletal elements play a role in organizing the cytoplasm and establishing distinct plasma membrane domains, they are well suited for positioning bud-site selection cues. Indeed, the septin-containing neck  filaments are crucial for establishing the axial budding  pattern characteristic of MATa and MAT$\alpha$ cells. In this  study, we determined the budding patterns of cells carrying mutations in the actin gene or in genes encoding  actin-associated proteins: MATa/$\alpha$ cells were defective  in the bipolar budding pattern, but MATa and MAT$\alpha$  cells still exhibit a normal axial budding pattern. We  also observed that MATa/$\alpha$ actin cytoskeleton mutant  daughter cells correctly position their first bud at the  distal pole of the cell, but mother cells position their  buds randomly. The actin cytoskeleton therefore functions in generation of the bipolar budding pattern and  is required specifically for proper selection of bud sites  in mother MATa/$\alpha$ cells. These observations and the  results of double mutant studies support the conclusion  that different rules govern bud-site selection in mother  and daughter MATa/$\alpha$ cells. A defective bipolar budding pattern did not preclude an sla2-6 mutant from undergoing pseudohyphal growth, highlighting the central  role of daughter cell bud-site selection cues in the formation of pseudohyphae. Finally, by examining the  budding patterns of mad2-1 mitotic checkpoint mutants  treated with benomyl to depolymerize their microtubules, we confirmed and extended previous evidence  indicating that microtubules do not function in axial or  bipolar bud-site selection.},

@article{Renard2015,
abstract = {During endocytosis, energy is invested to narrow the necks of cargo-containing plasma membrane invaginations to radii at which the opposing segments spontaneously coalesce, thereby leading to the detachment by scission of endocytic uptake carriers. In the clathrin pathway, dynamin uses mechanical energy from GTP hydrolysis to this effect, assisted by the BIN/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain-containing protein endophilin. Clathrin-independent endocytic events are often less reliant on dynamin, and whether in these cases BAR domain proteins such as endophilin contribute to scission has remained unexplored. Here we show, in human and other mammalian cell lines, that endophilin-A2 (endoA2) specifically and functionally associates with very early uptake structures that are induced by the bacterial Shiga and cholera toxins, which are both clathrin-independent endocytic cargoes. In controlled in vitro systems, endoA2 reshapes membranes before scission. Furthermore, we demonstrate that endoA2, dynamin and actin contribute in parallel to the scission of Shiga-toxin-induced tubules. Our results establish a novel function of endoA2 in clathrin-independent endocytosis. They document that distinct scission factors operate in an additive manner, and predict that specificity within a given uptake process arises from defined combinations of universal modules. Our findings highlight a previously unnoticed link between membrane scaffolding by endoA2 and pulling-force-driven dynamic scission.},

So far, crystal structures of 18 independent BAR domains including inverse-BAR domains and FCH-BAR domains have been reported. These atomic models show a vast variation of dimer shapes on a common and simple basic framework.

abstract = {Cells in the renal inner medulla are normally exposed to extraordinarily high levels of NaCl and urea. The osmotic stress causes numerous perturbations because of the hypertonic effect of high NaCl and the direct denaturation of cellular macromolecules by high urea. High NaCl and urea elevate reactive oxygen species, cause cytoskeletal rearrangement, inhibit DNA replication and transcription, inhibit translation, depolarize mitochondria, and damage DNA and proteins. Nevertheless, cells can accommodate by changes that include accumulation of organic osmolytes and increased expression of heat shock proteins. Failure to accommodate results in cell death by apoptosis. Although the adapted cells survive and function, many of the original perturbations persist, and even contribute to signaling the adaptive responses. This review addresses both the perturbing effects of high NaCl and urea and the adaptive responses. We speculate on the sensors of osmolality and document the multiple pathways that signal activation of the transcription factor TonEBP/OREBP, which directs many aspects of adaptation. The facts that numerous cellular functions are altered by hyperosmolality and remain so, even after adaptation, indicate that both the effects of hyperosmolality and adaptation to it involve profound alterations of the state of the cells.},

Clathrin- and actin-mediated endocytosis in yeast has proven a very powerful model to study this process, with more than 60 evolutionarily conserved proteins involved in fashioning primary endocytic vesicles. Major progress in the field has been made during the last decades by defining the sequential recruitment of the endocytic machinery at the cell cortex using live-cell fluorescence microscopy. Higher spatial resolution has been recently achieved by developing time-resolved electron microscopy methods, allowing for the first time the visualization of changes in the plasma membrane shape, coupled to the dynamics of the endocytic machinery. Here, we highlight these advances and review recent findings from yeast and mammals that have increased our understanding of where and how endocytic proteins may apply force to remodel the plasma membrane during different stages of the process.},

abstract = {Summary
F-BAR domain proteins regulate and sense membrane curvature by interacting with negatively charged phospholipids and assembling into higher-order scaffolds. However, regulatory mechanisms controlling these interactions are poorly understood. Here, we show that Drosophila Nervous Wreck (Nwk) is autoregulated by a C-terminal SH3 domain module that interacts directly with its F-BAR domain. Surprisingly, this autoregulation does not mediate a simple “on-off” switch for membrane remodeling. Instead, the isolated Nwk F-BAR domain efficiently assembles into higher-order structures and deforms membranes only within a limited range of negative membrane charge, and autoregulation elevates this range. Thus, autoregulation could either reduce membrane binding or promote higher-order assembly, depending on local cellular membrane composition. Our findings uncover an unexpected mechanism by which lipid composition directs membrane remodeling.},

@article{Sorre2012,
abstract = {Cells are populated by a vast array of membrane-binding proteins that execute critical functions. Functions, like signaling and intracellular transport, require the abilities to bind to highly curved membranes and to trigger membrane deformation. Among these proteins is amphiphysin 1, implicated in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It contains a Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs membrane-binding domain with an N-terminal amphipathic helix that senses and generates membrane curvature. However, an understanding of the parameters distinguishing these two functions is missing. By pulling a highly curved nanotube of controlled radius from a giant vesicle in a solution containing amphiphysin, we observed that the action of the protein depends directly on its density on the membrane. At low densities of protein on the nearly flat vesicle, the distribution of proteins and the mechanical effects induced are described by a model based on spontaneous curvature induction. The tube radius and force are modified by protein binding but still depend on membrane tension. In the dilute limit, when practically no proteins were present on the vesicle, no mechanical effects were detected, but strong protein enrichment proportional to curvature was seen on the tube. At high densities, the radius is independent of tension and vesicle protein density, resulting from the formation of a scaffold around the tube. As a consequence, the scaling of the force with tension is modified. For the entire density range, protein was enriched on the tube as compared to the vesicle. Our approach shows that the strength of curvature sensing and mechanical effects on the tube depends on the protein density.},

abstract = {Eps15-related proteins couple the clathrin-mediated endocytic-site initiation and actin assembly phases and coordinate endocytic-site formation with cargo capture and actin assembly through their interaction with a CIN85-related protein., More than 60 highly conserved proteins appear sequentially at sites of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in yeast and mammals. The yeast Eps15-related proteins Pan1 and End3 and the CIN85-related protein Sla1 are known to interact with each other in vitro, and they all appear after endocytic-site initiation but before endocytic actin assembly, which facilitates membrane invagination/scission. Here we used live-cell imaging in parallel with genetics and biochemistry to explore comprehensively the dynamic interactions and functions of Pan1, End3, and Sla1. Our results indicate that Pan1 and End3 associate in a stable manner and appear at endocytic sites before Sla1. The End3 C-terminus is necessary and sufficient for its cortical localization via interaction with Pan1, whereas the End3 N-terminus plays a crucial role in Sla1 recruitment. We systematically examined the dynamic behaviors of endocytic proteins in cells in which Pan1 and End3 were simultaneously eliminated, using the auxin-inducible degron system. The results lead us to propose that endocytic-site initiation and actin assembly are separable processes linked by a Pan1/End3/Sla1 complex. Finally, our study provides mechanistic insights into how Pan1 and End3 function with Sla1 to coordinate cargo capture with actin assembly.},

It is clear that they are synthesized and turned over following pathways similar to those described in higher eukaryotes. Recent studies on yeast have also suggested that inositol phospholipids may play roles in complex signalling pathways similar to those detected in animal cells. In addition, inositol has been demonstrated to function in yeast as a global regulator of phospholipid synthesis. This regulation occurs on a transcriptional level and is highly complex. It is not yet known whether similar inositol-mediated regulation of phospholipid synthesis occurs in other eukaryotes.},

abstract = {During endocytosis, actin-dependent forces are needed to oppose internal turgor pressure for invagination of the plasma membrane. Live-cell imaging shows that addition of sorbitol to the medium significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process and rescues defects of endocytic mutants in fission yeast., Yeast and other walled cells possess high internal turgor pressure that allows them to grow and survive in the environment. This turgor pressure, however, may oppose the invagination of the plasma membrane needed for endocytosis. Here we study the effects of turgor pressure on endocytosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by time-lapse imaging of individual endocytic sites. Decreasing effective turgor pressure by addition of sorbitol to the media significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process before actin assembly and membrane ingression but does not affect the velocity or depth of ingression of the endocytic pit in wild-type cells. Sorbitol also rescues endocytic ingression defects of certain endocytic mutants and of cells treated with a low dose of the actin inhibitor latrunculin A. Endocytosis proceeds after removal of the cell wall, suggesting that the cell wall does not contribute mechanically to this process. These studies suggest that endocytosis is governed by a mechanical balance between local actin-dependent inward forces and opposing forces from high internal turgor pressure on the plasma membrane.},

We report here that synaptojanin 1–deficient mice exhibit neurological defects and die shortly after birth. In neurons of mutant animals, PI(4,5)P2 levels are increased, and clathrin-coated vesicles accumulate in the cytomatrix-rich area that surrounds the synaptic vesicle cluster in nerve endings. In cell-free assays, reduced phosphoinositide phosphatase activity correlated with increased association of clathrin coats with liposomes. Intracellular recording in hippocampal slices revealed enhanced synaptic depression during prolonged high-frequency stimulation followed by delayed recovery. These results provide genetic evidence for a crucial role of phosphoinositide metabolism in synaptic vesicle recycling.},

abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis involves cargo selection and membrane budding into vesicles with the aid of a protein coat. Formation of invaginated pits on the plasma membrane and subsequent budding of vesicles is an energetically demanding process that involves the cooperation of clathrin with many different proteins. Here we investigate the role of the brain-enriched protein epsin 1 in this process. Epsin is targeted to areas of endocytosis by binding the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)). We show here that epsin 1 directly modifies membrane curvature on binding to PtdIns(4,5)P(2) in conjunction with clathrin polymerization. We have discovered that formation of an amphipathic alpha-helix in epsin is coupled to PtdIns(4,5)P(2) binding. Mutation of residues on the hydrophobic region of this helix abolishes the ability to curve membranes. We propose that this helix is inserted into one leaflet of the lipid bilayer, inducing curvature. On lipid monolayers epsin alone is sufficient to facilitate the formation of clathrin-coated invaginations.},

abstract = {Yeast and other walled cells possess high internal turgor pressure that allows them to grow and survive in the environment. This turgor pressure, however, may oppose the invagination of the plasma membrane needed for endocytosis. Here we study the effects of turgor pressure on endocytosis in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe by time-lapse imaging of individual endocytic sites. Decreasing effective turgor pressure by addition of sorbitol to the media significantly accelerates early steps in the endocytic process before actin assembly and membrane ingression but does not affect the velocity or depth of ingression of the endocytic pit in wild-type cells. Sorbitol also rescues endocytic ingression defects of certain endocytic mutants and of cells treated with a low dose of the actin inhibitor latrunculin A. Endocytosis proceeds after removal of the cell wall, suggesting that the cell wall does not contribute mechanically to this process. These studies suggest that endocytosis is governed by a mechanical balance between local actin-dependent inward forces and opposing forces from high internal turgor pressure on the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {Pombe Cdc15 homology (PCH) proteins play an important role in a variety of actin-based processes, including clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME). The defining feature of the PCH proteins is an evolutionarily conserved EFC/F-BAR domain for membrane association and tubulation. In the present study, we solved the crystal structures of the EFC domains of human FBP17 and CIP4. The structures revealed a gently curved helical-bundle dimer of approximately 220 A in length, which forms filaments through end-to-end interactions in the crystals. The curved EFC dimer fits a tubular membrane with an approximately 600 A diameter. We subsequently proposed a model in which the curved EFC filament drives tubulation. In fact, striation of tubular membranes was observed by phase-contrast cryo-transmission electron microscopy, and mutations that impaired filament formation also impaired membrane tubulation and cell membrane invagination. Furthermore, FBP17 is recruited to clathrin-coated pits in the late stage of CME, indicating its physiological role.},

abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is independent of actin dynamics in many circumstances but requires actin polymerization in others. We show that membrane tension determines the actin dependence of clathrin-coat assembly. As found previously, clathrin assembly supports formation of mature coated pits in the absence of actin polymerization on both dorsal and ventral surfaces of non-polarized mammalian cells, and also on basolateral surfaces of polarized cells. Actin engagement is necessary, however, to complete membrane deformation into a coated pit on apical surfaces of polarized cells and, more generally, on the surface of any cell in which the plasma membrane is under tension from osmotic swelling or mechanical stretching. We use these observations to alter actin dependence experimentally and show that resistance of the membrane to propagation of the clathrin lattice determines the distinction between 'actin dependent and 'actin independent'. We also find that light-chain-bound Hip1R mediates actin engagement. These data thus provide a unifying explanation for the role of actin dynamics in coated-pit budding.},

@article{Shen1999,
abstract = {For many organisms there is a correlation between increases of metabolites and osmotic stress tolerance, but the mechanisms that cause this protection are not clear. To understand the role of polyols, genes for bacterial mannitol-1-P dehydrogenase and apple sorbitol-6-P dehydrogenase were introduced into a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant deficient in glycerol synthesis. Sorbitol and mannitol provided some protection, but less than that generated by a similar concentration of glycerol generated by glycerol-3-P dehydrogenase (GPD1). Reduced protection by polyols suggested that glycerol had specific functions for which mannitol and sorbitol could not substitute, and that the absolute amount of the accumulating osmoticum might not be crucial. The retention of glycerol and mannitol/sorbitol, respectively, was a major difference. During salt stress, cells retained more of the six-carbon polyols than glycerol. We suggest that the loss of {\textgreater}98{\%} of the glycerol synthesized could provide a safety valve that dissipates reducing power, while a similar high intracellular concentration of retained polyols would be less protective. To understand the role of glycerol in salt tolerance, salt-tolerant suppressor mutants were isolated from the glycerol-deficient strain. One mutant, sr13, partially suppressed the salt-sensitive phenotype of the glycerol-deficient line, probably due to a doubling of [K+] accumulating during stress. We compare these results to the “osmotic adjustment” concept typically applied to accumulating metabolites in plants. The accumulation of polyols may have dual functions: facilitating osmotic adjustment and supporting redox control.
Selaginella lepidophylla is one of only a few species of spike mosses (Selaginellaceae) that have evolved desiccation tolerance (DT) or the ability to ‘resurrect' from an air-dried state. In order to understand the metabolic basis of DT, S. lepidophylla was subjected to a five-stage, rehydration/dehydration cycle, then analyzed using non-biased, global metabolomics profiling technology based on GC/MS and UHLC/MS/MS2 platforms. A total of 251 metabolites including 167 named (66.5{\%}) and 84 (33.4{\%}) unnamed compounds were characterized. Only 42 (16.7{\%}) and 74 (29.5{\%}) of compounds showed significantly increased or decreased abundance, respectively, indicating that most compounds were produced constitutively, including highly abundant trehalose, sucrose, and glucose. Several glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates showed increased abundance at 100{\%} relative water content (RWC) and 50{\%} RWC. Vanillate, a potent antioxidant, was also more abundant in the hydrated state. Many different sugar alcohols and sugar acids were more abundant in the hydrated state. These polyols likely decelerate the rate of water loss during the drying process as well as slow water absorption during rehydration, stabilize proteins, and scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). In contrast, nitrogen-rich and $\gamma$-glutamyl amino acids, citrulline, and nucleotide catabolism products (e.g. allantoin) were more abundant in the dry states, suggesting that these compounds might play important roles in nitrogen remobilization during rehydration or in ROS scavenging. UV-protective compounds such as 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, apigenin, and naringenin, were more abundant in the dry states. Most lipids were produced constitutively, with the exception of choline phosphate, which was more abundant in dry states and likely plays a role in membrane hydration and stabilization. In contrast, several polyunsaturated fatty acids were more abundant in the hydrated states, suggesting that these compounds likely help maintain membrane fluidity during dehydration. Lastly, S. lepidophylla contained seven unnamed compounds that displayed twofold or greater abundance in dry or rehydrating states, suggesting that these compounds might play adaptive roles in DT.},

abstract = {We have used affinity chromatography to identify two proteins that bind to the SH3 domain of the actin cytoskeleton protein Rvs167p: Gyp5p and Gyl1p. Gyp5p has been shown to be a GTPase activating protein (GAP) for Ypt1p, a Rab GTPase involved in ER to Golgi trafficking; Gyl1p is a protein that resembles Gyp5p and has recently been shown to colocalize with and belong to the same protein complex as Gyp5p. We show that Gyl1p and Gyp5p interact directly with each other, likely through their carboxy-terminal coiled-coil regions. In assays of GAP activity, Gyp5p had GAP activity toward Ypt1p and we found that this activity was stimulated by the addition of Gyl1p. Gyl1p had no GAP activity toward Ypt1p. Genetic experiments suggest a role for Gyp5p and Gyl1p in ER to Golgi trafficking, consistent with their biochemical role. Since Rvs167p has a previously characterized role in endocytosis and we have shown here that it interacts with proteins involved in Golgi vesicle trafficking, we suggest that Rvs167p may have a general role in vesicle trafficking.},

abstract = {Internalization of receptors, lipids, pathogens, and other cargo at the plasma membrane involves several different pathways and requires coordinated interactions between a variety of protein and lipid molecules. The actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cell cortex, and there is growing evidence that F-actin plays a direct role in these endocytic events. Genetic studies in yeast have firmly established a functional connection between actin and endocytosis. Identification of several proteins that may function at the interface between actin and the endocytic machinery has provided further evidence for this association in both yeast and mammalian cells. Several of these proteins are directly involved in regulating actin assembly and could thus harness forces produced during actin polymerization to facilitate specific steps in the endocytic process. Recent microscopy studies in mammalian cells provide powerful evidence that localized recruitment and polymerization of actin occurs at endocytic sites. In this review, we focus on progress made in elucidating the functions of the actin cytoskeleton in endocytosis.},

abstract = {Yeast Las17 protein is homologous to the Wiskott–Aldrich Syndrome protein, which is implicated in severe immunodeficiency. Las17p/Bee1p has been shown to be important for actin patch assembly and actin polymerization. Here we show that Las17p interacts with the Arp2/3 complex. LAS17 is an allele-specific multicopy suppressor of ARP2 and ARP3 mutations; overexpression restores both actin patch organization and endocytosis defects in ARP2 temperature-sensitive (ts) cells. Six of seven ARP2 ts mutants and at least one ARP3 ts mutant are synthetically lethal with las17$\Delta$ ts confirming functional interaction with the Arp2/3 complex. Further characterization of las17$\Delta$ cells showed that receptor-mediated internalization of $\alpha$ factor by the Ste2 receptor is severely defective. The polarity of normal bipolar bud site selection is lost. Las17-gfp remains localized in cortical patches in vivo independently of polymerized actin and is required for the polarized localization of Arp2/3 as well as actin. Coimmunoprecipitation of Arp2p with Las17p indicates that Las17p interacts directly with the complex. Two hybrid results also suggest that Las17p interacts with actin, verprolin, Rvs167p and several other proteins including Src homology 3 (SH3) domain proteins, suggesting that Las17p may integrate signals from different regulatory cascades destined for the Arp2/3p complex and the actin cytoskeleton.},

In contrast, protein coats and their associated accessory proteins drive membrane bending using a variety of interdependent physical mechanisms. We survey the energy costs and drivers involved in membrane curvature, and draw a contrast between the stochastic contributions of molecular crowding and the deterministic assembly of protein coats.

Many of these proteins are conserved in yeast yet lack observable mutant phenotypes, which suggests that yeast endocytosis may be subject to different regulatory mechanisms. Here, we have systematically defined genes required for internalization using a quantitative genome-wide screen that monitors localization of the yeast vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin homologue Snc1. Genetic interaction mapping was used to place these genes into functional modules containing known and novel endocytic regulators, and cargo selectivity was evaluated by an array-based comparative analysis. We demonstrate that clathrin and the yeast AP180 clathrin adaptor proteins have a cargo-specific role in Snc1 internalization. We additionally identify low dye binding 17 (LDB17) as a novel conserved component of the endocytic machinery. Ldb17 is recruited to cortical actin patches before actin polymerization and regulates normal coat dynamics and actin assembly. Our findings highlight the conserved machinery and reveal novel mechanisms that underlie endocytic internalization.},

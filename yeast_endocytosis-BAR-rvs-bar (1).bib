abstract = {Endophilin/SH3p4 is a protein highly enriched in nerve terminals that binds the GTPase dynamin and the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin, two proteins implicated in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. We show here that antibody-mediated disruption of endophilin function in a tonically stimulated synapse leads to a block in the invagination of clathrin-coated pits adjacent to the active zone and therefore to a block of synaptic vesicle recycling. We also show that in a cell-free system, endophilin is not associated with clathrin coats and is a functional partner of dynamin. Our findings suggest that endophilin is part of a biochemical machinery that acts in trans to the clathrin coat from early stages to vesicle fission.},

abstract = {Cellular proteins containing Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domains play a key role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Despite extensive structural and functional studies of BAR domains, it is still unknown how exactly these domains interact with the plasma membrane containing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)) and whether they function by a universal mechanism or by different mechanisms. Here we report that PtdIns(4,5)P(2) specifically induces partial membrane penetration of the N-terminal amphiphilic $\alpha$-helix (H(0)) of two representative N-BAR domains from Drosophila amphiphysin (dAmp-BAR) and rat endophilin A1 (EndoA1-BAR). Our quantitative fluorescence imaging analysis shows that PtdIns(4,5)P(2)-dependent membrane penetration of H(0) is important for self-association of membrane-bound dAmp-BAR and EndoA1-BAR and their membrane deformation activity. EndoA1-BAR behaves differently from dAmp-BAR because the former has an additional amphiphilic $\alpha$-helix that penetrates the membrane in a PtdIns(4,5)P(2)-independent manner. Depletion of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) from the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells abrogated the membrane deforming activity of EndoA1-BAR and dAmp-BAR. Collectively, these studies suggest that the local PtdIns(4,5)P(2) concentration in the plasma membrane may regulate the membrane interaction and deformation by N-BAR domain-containing proteins during clathrin-mediated endocytosis.},

@article{Shupliakov1997,
abstract = {The proline-rich COOH-terminal region of dynamin binds various Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-containing proteins, but the physiological role of these interactions is unknown. In living nerve terminals, the function of the interaction with SH3 domains was examined. Amphiphysin contains an SH3 domain and is a major dynamin binding partner at the synapse. Microinjection of amphiphysin's SH3 domain or of a dynamin peptide containing the SH3 binding site inhibited synaptic vesicle endocytosis at the stage of invaginated clathrin-coated pits, which resulted in an activity-dependent distortion of the synaptic architecture and a depression of transmitter release. These findings demonstrate that SH3-mediated interactions are required for dynamin function and support an essential role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in synaptic vesicle recycling.},

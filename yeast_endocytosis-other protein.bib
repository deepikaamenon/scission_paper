abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a highly conserved intracellular trafficking pathway that depends on dynamic protein-protein interactions between up to 60 different proteins. However, little is known about the spatio-temporal regulation of these interactions. Using fluorescence (cross)-correlation spectroscopy in yeast, we tested 41 previously reported interactions in vivo and found 16 to exist in the cytoplasm. These detected cytoplasmic interactions included the self-interaction of Ede1, homolog of mammalian Eps15. Ede1 is the crucial scaffold for the organization of the early stages of endocytosis. We show that oligomerization of Ede1 through its central coiled coil domain is necessary for its localization to the endocytic site and we link the oligomerization of Ede1 to its function in locally concentrating endocytic adaptors and organizing the endocytic machinery. Our study sheds light on the importance of the regulation of protein-protein interactions in the cytoplasm for the assembly of the endocytic machinery in vivo.},

@article{Colwill1999,
abstract = {Morphological changes during cell division in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are controlled by cell-cycle regulators. The Pcl-Pho85p kinase complex has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton at least in part through Rvs167p. Rvs167p consists of three domains called BAR, GPA, and SH3. Using a two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that each region of Rvs167p participates in protein-protein interactions: the BAR domain bound the BAR domain of another Rvs167p protein and that of Rvs161p, the GPA region bound Pcl2p, and the SH3 domain bound Abp1p. We identified Rvs167p as a Las17p/Bee1p-interacting protein in a two-hybrid screen and showed that Las17p/Bee1p bound the SH3 domain of Rvs167p. We tested the extent to which the Rvs167p protein domains rescued phenotypes associated with deletion of RVS167: salt sensitivity, random budding, and endocytosis and sporulation defects. The BAR domain was sufficient for full or partial rescue of all rvs167 mutant phenotypes tested but not required for the sporulation defect for which the SH3 domain was also sufficient. Overexpression of Rvs167p inhibits cell growth. The BAR domain was essential for this inhibition and the SH3 domain had only a minor effect. Rvs167p may link the cell cycle regulator Pcl-Pho85p kinase and the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that Rvs167p is activated by phosphorylation in its GPA region by the Pcl-Pho85p kinase. Upon activation, Rvs167p enters a multiprotein complex, making critical contacts in its BAR domain and redundant or minor contacts with its SH3 domain.},

@article{Cerveny2007,
abstract = {In many organisms, ranging from yeast to humans, mitochondria fuse and divide to change their morphology in response to a multitude of signals. During the past decade, work using yeast and mammalian cells has identified much of the machinery required for fusion and division, including the dynamin-related GTPases – mitofusins (Fzo1p in yeast) and OPA1 (Mgm1p in yeast) for fusion and Drp1 (Dnm1p) for division. However, the mechanisms by which cells regulate these dynamic processes have remained largely unknown. Recent studies have uncovered regulatory mechanisms that control the activity, assembly, distribution and stability of the key components for mitochondrial fusion and division. In this review, we discuss how mitochondrial dynamics are controlled and how these events are coordinated with cell growth, mitosis, apoptosis and human diseases.},

@article{Mulholland1994,
abstract = {We characterized the yeast actin cytoskeleton at the ultrastructural level using immunoelectron microscopy. Anti-actin antibodies primarily labeled dense, patchlike cortical structures and cytoplasmic cables. This localization recapitulates results obtained with immunofluorescence light microscopy, but at much higher resolution. Immuno-EM double-labeling experiments were conducted with antibodies to actin together with antibodies to the actin binding proteins Abp1p and cofilin. As expected from immunofluorescence experiments, Abp1p, cofilin, and actin colocalized in immuno-EM to the dense patchlike structures but not to the cables. In this way, we can unambiguously identify the patches as the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The cortical actin patches were observed to be associated with the cell surface via an invagination of plasma membrane. This novel cortical cytoskeleton-plasma membrane interface appears to consist of a fingerlike invagination of plasma membrane around which actin filaments and actin binding proteins are organized. We propose a possible role for this unique cortical structure in wall growth and osmotic regulation.},

abstract = {Branched and crosslinked actin networks mediate cellular processes that move and shape membranes. To understand the mechanisms of force-generation by actin, we used a hybrid imaging approach that combines live imaging with correlative microscopy to analyse deletion mutants of yeast actin network components. Our data show that the actin network needs to be physically linked to the plasma membrane to overcome a force threshold for initiating membrane bending. Two force-generating mechanisms reshape the membrane in successive phases. First, nucleation and polymerization of new actin filaments pull the membrane invagi- nation. Then, rearrangement and expansion of the actin network provide the driving force for vesicle formation and propulsion. The transition between the phases occurs 2 seconds before scission when the filament nucleation rate drops. Our findings suggest that actin-based motili- ty can be uncoupled from actin network growth and can be driven by the release of stress accumulated by the crosslinked actin network.},

@article{Munn1995,
abstract = {Four mutants defective in endocytosis were isolated by screening a collection of temper-ature-sensitive yeast mutants. Three mutations define new END genes: end5-1, end6-1, and end7-1. The fourth mutation is in END4, a gene identified previously. The end5-1, end6-1, and end7-1 mutations do not affect vacuolar protein localization, indicating that the defect in each mutant is specific for internalization at the plasma membrane. Inter-estingly, localization of actin patches on the plasma membrane is affected in each of the mutants. end5-1, end6-1, and end7-1 are allelic to VRP1, RVS161, and ACTI, respectively. VRP1 and RVS161 are required for correct actin localization and ACTi encodes actin. To our surprise, the end6 -1 mutation fails to complement the actl-l mutation. Disruption of the RVS167 gene, which is homologous to END6/RVS161 and which is also required for correct actin localization, also blocks endocytosis. The end7-1 mutant allele has a glycine 48 to aspartic acid substitution in the DNase I-binding loop of actin. We propose that Vrplp, Rvs161p, and Rvs167p are components of a cytoskeletal structure that contains actin and fimbrin and that is required for formation of endocytic vesicles at the plasma membrane.},

abstract = {The Arp2/3 complex is essential for actin assembly and motility in many cell processes, and a large number of proteins have been found to bind and regulate it in vitro. A critical challenge is to understand the actions of these proteins in cells, especially in settings where multiple regulators are present. In a systematic study of the sequential multicomponent actin assembly processes that accompany endocytosis in yeast, we examined and compared the roles of WASp, two type-I myosins, and two other Arp2/3 activators, along with that of coronin, which is a proposed inhibitor of Arp2/3. Quantitative analysis of high-speed fluorescence imaging revealed individual functions for the regulators, manifested in part by novel phenotypes. We conclude that Arp2/3 regulators have distinct and overlapping roles in the processes of actin assembly that drive endocytosis in yeast. The formation of the endocytic actin patch, the creation of the endocytic vesicle, and the movement of the vesicle into the cytoplasm display distinct dependencies on different Arp2/3 regulators. Knowledge of these roles provides insight into the in vivo relevance of the dendritic nucleation model for actin assembly.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}In a previous paper (Picco et al., 2015), the dynamic architecture of the protein machinery during clathrin-mediated endocytosis was visualized using a new live imaging and particle tracking method. Here, by combining this approach with correlative light and electron microscopy, we address the role of clathrin in this process. During endocytosis, clathrin forms a cage-like coat around the membrane and associated protein components. There is growing evidence that clathrin does not determine the membrane morphology of the invagination but rather modulates the progression of endocytosis. We investigate how the deletion of clathrin heavy chain impairs the dynamics and the morphology of the endocytic membrane in budding yeast. Our results show that clathrin is not required for elongating or shaping the endocytic membrane invagination. Instead, we find that clathrin contributes to the regularity of vesicle scission and thereby to controlling vesicle size.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {In budding yeast, many proteins involved in endocytic internalization, including adaptors and actin cytoskeletal proteins, are localized to cortical patches of differing protein composition. Using multicolor real-time fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking algorithms, we define an early endocytic pathway wherein an invariant sequence of changes in cortical patch protein composition correlates with changes in patch motility. Three Arp2/3 activators each showed a distinct behavior, suggesting distinct patch-related endocytic functions. Actin polymerization occurs late in the endocytic pathway and is required both for endocytic internalization and for patch disassembly. In cells lacking the highly conserved endocytic protein Sla2p, patch motility was arrested and actin comet tails associated with endocytic patch complexes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of the actin comet tails revealed that endocytic complexes are nucleation sites for rapid actin polymerization. Attention is now focused on the mechanisms by which the order and timing of events in this endocytic pathway are achieved.},

@article{Brach2014,
abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is driven by a complex machinery of proteins, which assemble in a regular order at the plasma membrane [1–3]. The assembly of the endocytic machinery is conventionally thought to be a continuous process of mechanistically dependent steps, starting from a defined initiation step. Indeed, several initiation mechanisms involving single proteins have been proposed in mammalian cells [4, 5]. Here, we demonstrate that the initiation mechanism of endocytosis is highly flexible. We disrupted the long early phase of endocytosis in yeast by deleting seven genes encoding early endocytic proteins. Surprisingly, membrane uptake and vesicle budding dynamics were largely normal in these mutant cells. Regulated cargo recruitment was, however, defective. In addition, different early endocytic proteins were able to initiate vesicle budding when anchored to a plasma membrane domain where endocytosis does not normally take place. Our results suggest that the cargo-recruiting early phase is not mechanistically required for vesicle budding, but early-arriving proteins can recruit the budding machinery into position at the plasma membrane. Separable early and late phases allow for a robust process of vesicle budding to follow from variable initiation mechanisms. Such a modular design could easily adapt and evolve to respond to different cellular requirements.},

@article{Raths1993a,
abstract = {alpha-factor, one of two peptide hormones responsible for synchronized mating between MATa and MAT alpha-cell types in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, binds to its cell surface receptor and is internalized in a time-, temperature-, and energy-dependent manner (Chvatchko, Y., I. Howald, and H. Riezman. 1986. Cell. 46:355-364). After internalization, alpha-factor is delivered to the vacuole via vesicular intermediates and degraded there consistent with an endocytic mechanism (Singer, B., and H. Riezman. 1990. J. Cell Biol. 110:1911-1922; Chvatchko, Y., I. Howald, and H. Riezman. 1986. Cell. 46:355-364). We have isolated two mutants that are defective in the internalization process. Both mutations confer a recessive, temperature-sensitive growth phenotype upon cells that cosegregates with their endocytosis defect. Lucifer yellow, a marker for fluid-phase endocytosis, shows accumulation characteristics in the mutants that are similar to the uptake characteristics of 35S-alpha-factor. The endocytic defect in end4 cells appears immediately upon shift to restrictive temperature and is reversible at permissive temperature if new protein synthesis is allowed. Furthermore, the end4 mutation only affects alpha-factor internalization and not the later delivery of alpha-factor to the vacuole. Other vesicle-mediated processes seem to be normal in end3 and end4 mutants. END3 and END4 are the first genes shown to be necessary for the internalization step of receptor-borne and fluid-phase markers in yeast.},

To understand the underlying mechanism, we have characterized the actin-binding protein MoAbp1 that interacts with MoArk1 from M. oryzae. The $\Delta$Moabp1 mutant exhibited delayed endocytosis and defects in the growth, host penetration, and invasive growth. Consistent with its putative function associated with actin-binding, MoAbp1 regulates the localization of actin patches and plays a role in MoArk1 phosphorylation. In addition, MoAbp1 interacts with MoCap1 affecting its normal patch localization pattern and the actin protein MoAct1 through its conserved domains. Taken together, our results support a notion that MoAbp1 functions as a protein scaffold linking MoArk1, MoCap1 and MoAct1 to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics critical in growth and pathogenicity of the blast fungus.},

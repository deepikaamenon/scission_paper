abstract = {▪ Abstract Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast and animal cells have led to the identification of many components required for endocytosis. In this review, we summarize our understanding of the endocytic machinery with an emphasis on the proteins regulating the internalization step of endocytosis and endosome fusion. Even though the overall endocytic machinery appears to be conserved between yeast and animals, clear differences exist. We also discuss the roles of phosphoinositides, sterols, and sphingolipid precursors in endocytosis, because in addition to proteins, these lipids have emerged as important determinants in the spatial and most likely temporal specificity of endocytic membrane trafficking events.},

@article{Zhu2007,
abstract = {APPL1 is an effector of the small GTPase Rab5. Together, they mediate a signal transduction pathway initiated by ligand binding to cell surface receptors. Interaction with Rab5 is confined to the amino (N)-terminal region of APPL1. We report the crystal structures of human APPL1 N-terminal BAR-PH domain motif. The BAR and PH domains, together with a novel linker helix, form an integrated, crescent-shaped, symmetrical dimer. This BAR-PH interaction is likely conserved in the class of BAR-PH containing proteins. Biochemical analyses indicate two independent Rab-binding sites located at the opposite ends of the dimer, where the PH domain directly interacts with Rab5 and Rab21. Besides structurally supporting the PH domain, the BAR domain also contributes to Rab binding through a small surface region in the vicinity of the PH domain. In stark contrast to the helix-dominated, Rab-binding domains previously reported, APPL1 PH domain employs beta-strands to interact with Rab5. On the Rab5 side, both switch regions are involved in the interaction. Thus we identified a new binding mode between PH domains and small GTPases.},

A high lipid diversity is universal in eukaryotes and is seen from the scale of a membrane leaflet to that of a whole organism, highlighting its importance and suggesting that membrane lipids fulfil many functions. Indeed, alterations of membrane lipid homeostasis are linked to various diseases. While many of their functions remain unknown, interdisciplinary approaches have begun to reveal novel functions of lipids and their interactions. We are beginning to understand why even small changes in lipid structures and in composition can have profound effects on crucial biological functions.},

abstract = {Endophilin/SH3p4 is a protein highly enriched in nerve terminals that binds the GTPase dynamin and the polyphosphoinositide phosphatase synaptojanin, two proteins implicated in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. We show here that antibody-mediated disruption of endophilin function in a tonically stimulated synapse leads to a block in the invagination of clathrin-coated pits adjacent to the active zone and therefore to a block of synaptic vesicle recycling. We also show that in a cell-free system, endophilin is not associated with clathrin coats and is a functional partner of dynamin. Our findings suggest that endophilin is part of a biochemical machinery that acts in trans to the clathrin coat from early stages to vesicle fission.},

abstract = {Membranes of intracellular organelles are characterized by large curvatures with radii of the order of 10–30nm. While, generally, membrane curvature can be a consequence of any asymmetry between the membrane monolayers, generation of large curvatures requires the action of mechanisms based on specialized proteins. Here we discuss the three most relevant classes of such mechanisms with emphasis on the physical requirements for proteins to be effective in generation of membrane curvature. We provide new quantitative estimates of membrane bending by shallow hydrophobic insertions and compare the efficiency of the insertion mechanism with those of the protein scaffolding and crowding mechanisms.},

abstract = {Functioning as key players in cellular regulation of membrane curvature, BAR domain proteins bend bilayers and recruit interaction partners through poorly understood mechanisms. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we present reconstructions of full-length endophilin and its N-terminal N-BAR domain in their membrane-bound state. Endophilin lattices expose large areas of membrane surface and are held together by promiscuous interactions between endophilin's amphipathic N-terminal helices. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that endophilin lattices are highly dynamic and that the N-terminal helices are required for formation of a stable and regular scaffold. Furthermore, endophilin accommodates different curvatures through a quantized addition or removal of endophilin dimers, which in some cases causes dimerization of endophilin's SH3 domains, suggesting that the spatial presentation of SH3 domains, rather than affinity, governs the recruitment of downstream interaction partners.},

@article{Liu2015,
abstract = {Eukaryotic cell membrane dynamics change in curvature during physiological and pathological processes. In the past ten years, a novel protein family, Fes/CIP4 homology-Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (F-BAR) domain proteins, has been identified to be the most important coordinators in membrane curvature regulation. The F-BAR domain family is a member of the Bin/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain superfamily that is associated with dynamic changes in cell membrane. However, the molecular basis in membrane structure regulation and the biological functions of F-BAR protein are unclear. The pathophysiological role of F-BAR protein is unknown. This review summarizes the current understanding of structure and function in the BAR domain superfamily, classifies F-BAR family proteins into nine subfamilies based on domain structure, and characterizes F-BAR protein structure, domain interaction, and functional relevance. In general, F-BAR protein binds to cell membrane via F-BAR domain association with membrane phospholipids and initiates membrane curvature and scission via Src homology-3 (SH3) domain interaction with its partner proteins. This process causes membrane dynamic changes and leads to seven important cellular biological functions, which include endocytosis, phagocytosis, filopodium, lamellipodium, cytokinesis, adhesion, and podosome formation, via distinct signaling pathways determined by specific domain-binding partners. These cellular functions play important roles in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. We further summarize F-BAR protein expression and mutation changes observed in various diseases and developmental disorders. Considering the structure feature and functional implication of F-BAR proteins, we anticipate that F-BAR proteins modulate physiological and pathophysiological processes via transferring extracellular materials, regulating cell trafficking and mobility, presenting antigens, mediating extracellular matrix degradation, and transmitting signaling for cell proliferation.},

@article{Sigismund2012,
abstract = {Our understanding of endocytosis has evolved remarkably in little more than a decade. This is the result not only of advances in our knowledge of its molecular and biological workings, but also of a true paradigm shift in our understanding of what really constitutes endocytosis and of its role in homeostasis. Although endocytosis was initially discovered and studied as a relatively simple process to transport molecules across the plasma membrane, it was subsequently found to be inextricably linked with almost all aspects of cellular signaling. This led to the notion that endocytosis is actually the master organizer of cellular signaling, providing the cell with understandable messages that have been resolved in space and time. In essence, endocytosis provides the communications and supply routes (the logistics) of the cell. Although this may seem revolutionary, it is still likely to be only a small part of the entire story. A wealth of new evidence is uncovering the surprisingly pervasive nature of endocytosis in essentially all aspects of cellular regulation. In addition, many newly discovered functions of endocytic proteins are not immediately interpretable within the classical view of endocytosis. A possible framework, to rationalize all this new knowledge, requires us to "upgrade" our vision of endocytosis. By combining the analysis of biochemical, biological, and evolutionary evidence, we propose herein that endocytosis constitutes one of the major enabling conditions that in the history of life permitted the development of a higher level of organization, leading to the actuation of the eukaryotic cell plan.},

@article{Kanaseki1969,
abstract = {Five points are discussed regarding the vesicular structure isolated by fractionation techniques from the brain and liver of the guinea pig. 1. One type of vesicle, fixed by OsO(4) and shown in thin sections, is identified with the coated vesicle that has been observed in many varieties of tissues. 2. The vesicle contained in a spherical polygonal "basketwork" shown by the negative-staining techniques is identical with the coated vesicle shown in sections. 3. Despite minute observation of this basketwork we could not confirm the existence of "hairlike projections" extending from the convex cytoplasmic surface of the vesicle. We are inclined to believe, therefore, that the hairlike projections are actually the superimposed visual images of the regular hexagons and pentagons of the network composing the basketwork. 4. We repeat the hypothesis originally advanced by Roth and Porter (1) that the "coating" of the coated vesicle plays a role in the mechanism of the infolding and fission of the membrane; we suggest that these events are caused by the transformation of the regular hexagons (of the coating) into regular pentagons. 5. Finally, we make a suggestion as to the nature of those vesicles which have on their surface subparticles which look like "elementary particles (2)."},

abstract = {Against the odds of membrane resistance, members of the BIN/Amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain superfamily shape membranes and their activity is indispensable for a plethora of life functions. While crystal structures of different BAR dimers advanced our understanding of membrane shaping by scaffolding and hydrophobic insertion mechanisms considerably, especially life-imaging techniques and loss-of-function studies of clathrin-mediated endocytosis with its gradually increasing curvature show that the initial idea that solely BAR domain curvatures determine their functions is oversimplified. Diagonal placing, lateral lipid-binding modes, additional lipid-binding modules, tilde shapes and formation of macromolecular lattices with different modes of organisation and arrangement increase versatility. A picture emerges, in which BAR domain proteins create macromolecular platforms, that recruit and connect different binding partners and ensure the connection and coordination of the different events during the endocytic process, such as membrane invagination, coat formation, actin nucleation, vesicle size control, fission, detachment and uncoating, in time and space, and may thereby offer mechanistic explanations for how coordination, directionality and effectiveness of a complex process with several steps and key players can be achieved.},

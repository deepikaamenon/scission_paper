abstract = {Branched and crosslinked actin networks mediate cellular processes that move and shape membranes. To understand the mechanisms of force-generation by actin, we used a hybrid imaging approach that combines live imaging with correlative microscopy to analyse deletion mutants of yeast actin network components. Our data show that the actin network needs to be physically linked to the plasma membrane to overcome a force threshold for initiating membrane bending. Two force-generating mechanisms reshape the membrane in successive phases. First, nucleation and polymerization of new actin filaments pull the membrane invagi- nation. Then, rearrangement and expansion of the actin network provide the driving force for vesicle formation and propulsion. The transition between the phases occurs 2 seconds before scission when the filament nucleation rate drops. Our findings suggest that actin-based motili- ty can be uncoupled from actin network growth and can be driven by the release of stress accumulated by the crosslinked actin network.},

@article{Mulholland1994,
abstract = {We characterized the yeast actin cytoskeleton at the ultrastructural level using immunoelectron microscopy. Anti-actin antibodies primarily labeled dense, patchlike cortical structures and cytoplasmic cables. This localization recapitulates results obtained with immunofluorescence light microscopy, but at much higher resolution. Immuno-EM double-labeling experiments were conducted with antibodies to actin together with antibodies to the actin binding proteins Abp1p and cofilin. As expected from immunofluorescence experiments, Abp1p, cofilin, and actin colocalized in immuno-EM to the dense patchlike structures but not to the cables. In this way, we can unambiguously identify the patches as the cortical actin cytoskeleton. The cortical actin patches were observed to be associated with the cell surface via an invagination of plasma membrane. This novel cortical cytoskeleton-plasma membrane interface appears to consist of a fingerlike invagination of plasma membrane around which actin filaments and actin binding proteins are organized. We propose a possible role for this unique cortical structure in wall growth and osmotic regulation.},

@article{Galletta2008a,
abstract = {The Arp2/3 complex is essential for actin assembly and motility in many cell processes, and a large number of proteins have been found to bind and regulate it in vitro. A critical challenge is to understand the actions of these proteins in cells, especially in settings where multiple regulators are present. In a systematic study of the sequential multicomponent actin assembly processes that accompany endocytosis in yeast, we examined and compared the roles of WASp, two type-I myosins, and two other Arp2/3 activators, along with that of coronin, which is a proposed inhibitor of Arp2/3. Quantitative analysis of high-speed fluorescence imaging revealed individual functions for the regulators, manifested in part by novel phenotypes. We conclude that Arp2/3 regulators have distinct and overlapping roles in the processes of actin assembly that drive endocytosis in yeast. The formation of the endocytic actin patch, the creation of the endocytic vesicle, and the movement of the vesicle into the cytoplasm display distinct dependencies on different Arp2/3 regulators. Knowledge of these roles provides insight into the in vivo relevance of the dendritic nucleation model for actin assembly.},

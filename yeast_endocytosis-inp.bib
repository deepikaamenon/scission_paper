abstract = {▪ Abstract Genetic and biochemical studies in yeast and animal cells have led to the identification of many components required for endocytosis. In this review, we summarize our understanding of the endocytic machinery with an emphasis on the proteins regulating the internalization step of endocytosis and endosome fusion. Even though the overall endocytic machinery appears to be conserved between yeast and animals, clear differences exist. We also discuss the roles of phosphoinositides, sterols, and sphingolipid precursors in endocytosis, because in addition to proteins, these lipids have emerged as important determinants in the spatial and most likely temporal specificity of endocytic membrane trafficking events.},

@article{Sun2007a,
abstract = {The lipid phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns[4,5]P2) appears to play an important role in endocytosis. However, the timing of its formation and turnover, and its specific functions at different stages during endocytic internalization, have not been established. In this study, Sla2 ANTH-GFP and Sjl2-3GFP were expressed as functional fusion proteins at endogenous levels to quantitatively explore PtdIns(4,5)P2 dynamics during endocytosis in yeast. Our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels increase and decline in conjunction with coat and actin assembly and disassembly, respectively. Live-cell image analysis of endocytic protein dynamics in an sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant, which has elevated PtdIns(4,5)P2 levels, revealed that the endocytic machinery is still able to assemble and disassemble dynamically, albeit nonproductively. The defects in the dynamic behavior of the various endocytic proteins in this double mutant suggest that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover is required for multiple stages during endocytic vesicle formation. Furthermore, our results indicate that PtdIns(4,5)P2 turnover may act in coordination with the Ark1/Prk1 protein kinases in stimulating disassembly of the endocytic machinery.},

@article{Roux2005a,
abstract = {We have recently developed a minimal system for generating long tubular nanostructures that resemble tubes observed in vivo with biological membranes. Here, we studied membrane tube pulling in ternary mixtures of sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. Two salient results emerged: the lipid composition is significantly different in the tubes and in the vesicles; tube fission is observed when phase separation is generated in the tubes. This shows that lipid sorting may depend critically on both membrane curvature and phase separation. Phase separation also appears to be important for membrane fission in tubes pulled out of giant liposomes or purified Golgi membranes.},

@article{Stolz1998,
abstract = {Sequence analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IX identified a 946 amino acid open reading frame (YIL002C), designated here as INP51, that has carboxyl- and amino-terminal regions similar to mammalian inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases and to yeast SAC1. This two-domain primary structure resembles the mammalian 5-phosphatase, synaptojanin. We report that Inp51p is associated with a particulate fraction and that recombinant Inp51p exhibits intrinsic phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity. Deletion of INP51 (inp51) results in a "cold-tolerant" phenotype, enabling significantly faster growth at temperatures below 15 degreesC as compared with a parental strain. Complementation analysis of an inp51 mutant strain demonstrates that the cold tolerance is strictly due to loss of 5-phosphatase catalytic activity. Furthermore, deletion of PLC1 in an inp51 mutant does not abrogate cold tolerance, indicating that Plc1p-mediated production of soluble inositol phosphates is not required. Cells lacking INP51 have a 2-4-fold increase in levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and inositol 1,4, 5-trisphosphate, whereas cells overexpressing Inp51p exhibit a 35{\%} decrease in levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. We conclude that INP51 function is critical for proper phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate homeostasis. In addition, we define a novel role for a 5-phosphatase loss of function mutant that improves the growth of cells at colder temperatures without alteration of growth at normal temperatures, which may have useful commercial applications.},

@article{Srinivasan1997,
abstract = {As a result of the genome sequencing project in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, three open reading frames were found in the yeast genome that contain sequences with strong homology to all the domains conserved among the four mammalian phosphatidylinositol-phosphate 5-phosphatases: inpp5bp, ocrl1p, synaptojanin, and ship. In addition, all three yeast gene products shared with synaptojanin regions of homology to the SAC1 gene of yeast. Disruption of each of these genes singly and in pairs produced mutant strains that were viable but demonstrated variable phenotypes of abnormal vacuolar and plasma membrane morphology as well as increased sensitivity to osmotic stress. Total phosphatidylinositol-(4,5)-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity was reduced to varying degrees in each of the strains. No defect in carboxypeptidase Y sorting was seen in a processing and targeting assay. Abnormal actin cytoskeleton morphology was present in some of the strains carrying mutations in two of the genes.},

@article{Stefan2002a,
abstract = {Phosphoinositides (PI) are synthesized and turned over by specific kinases, phosphatases, and lipases that ensure the proper localization of discrete PI isoforms at distinct membranes. We analyzed the role of the yeast synaptojanin-like proteins using a strain that expressed only a temperature-conditional allele of SJL2. Our analysis demonstrated that inactivation of the yeast synaptojanins leads to increased cellular levels of phosphatidylinositol (3,5)-bisphosphate and phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P(2)), accompanied by defects in actin organization, endocytosis, and clathrin-mediated sorting between the Golgi and endosomes. The phenotypes observed in synaptojanin-deficient cells correlated with accumulation of PtdIns(4,5)P(2), because these effects were rescued by mutations in MSS4 or a mutant form of Sjl2p that harbors only PI 5-phosphatase activity. We utilized green fluorescent protein-pleckstrin homology domain chimeras (termed FLAREs for fluorescent lipid-associated reporters) with distinct PI-binding specificities to visualize pools of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate in yeast. PtdIns(4,5)P(2) localized to the plasma membrane in a manner dependent on Mss4p activity. On inactivation of the yeast synaptojanins, PtdIns(4,5)P(2) accumulated in intracellular compartments, as well as the cell surface. In contrast, phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate generated by Pik1p localized in intracellular compartments. Taken together, our results demonstrate that the yeast synaptojanins control the localization of PtdIns(4,5)P(2) in vivo and provide further evidence for the compartmentalization of different PI species.},

@article{Stefan2005,
abstract = {The Saccharomyces cerevisiae synaptojanin-like proteins (Sjl1, Sjl2, and Sjl3) are phosphoinositide (PI) phosphatases that regulate PI metabolism in the control of actin organization and membrane trafficking. However, the primary sites of action for each of the yeast synaptojanin-like proteins remain unclear. In this study, we show that Sjl2 is localized to cortical actin patches, sites of endocytosis. Cortical recruitment of Sjl2 requires the actin patch component Abp1. Consistent with this, the SH3 domain-containing protein Abp1 physically associates with Sjl2 through its proline-rich domain. Furthermore, abp1$\Delta$ mutations confer defects resembling loss of SJL2; sjl1$\Delta$ abp1$\Delta$ double-mutant cells exhibit invaginated plasma membranes and impaired endocytosis, findings similar to those for sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant cells. Thus, Abp1 acts as an adaptor protein in the localization or concentration of Sjl2 during late stages of endocytic vesicle formation. Overexpression of the Hip1-related protein Sla2 delayed the formation of extended plasma membrane invaginations in sjl2ts cells, indicating that Sla2 may become limiting or misregulated in cells with impaired PI phosphatase activity. Consistent with this, the cortical actin patch protein Sla2 is mislocalized in sjl1$\Delta$ sjl2$\Delta$ mutant cells. Together, our studies suggest that PI metabolism by the synaptojanin-like proteins coordinately directs actin dynamics and membrane invagination, in part by regulation of Sla2.},

@article{Singer-Kruger1998,
abstract = {The synaptojanins represent a subfamily of inositol 5'-phosphatases that contain an NH2-terminal Sac1p homology domain. A nerve terminal-enriched synaptojanin, synaptojanin 1, was previously proposed to participate in the endocytosis of synaptic vesicles and actin function. The genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae contains three synaptojanin-like genes (SJL1, SJL2 and SJL3), none of which is essential for growth. We report here that a yeast mutant lacking SJL1 and SJL2 (Deltasjl1 Deltasjl2) exhibits a severe defect in receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis. A less severe endocytic defect is present in a Deltasjl2 Deltasjl3 mutant, while endocytosis is normal in a Deltasjl1 Deltasjl3 mutant. None of the mutants are impaired in invertase secretion. The severity of the endocytic impairment of the sjl double mutants correlates with the severity of actin and polarity defects. Furthermore, the deletion of SJL1 suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect of sac6, a mutant in yeast fimbrin, supporting a role for synaptojanin family members in actin function. These findings provide a first direct evidence for a role of synaptojanin family members in endocytosis and provide further evidence for a close link between endocytosis and actin function.},

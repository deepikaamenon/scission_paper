@article{Kay2000a,
abstract = {Acommon focus among molecular and cellular biologists is the identification of proteins that interact with each other. Yeast two-hybrid, cDNA expression library screening, and coimmunoprecipitation experiments are powerful methods for identifying novel proteins that bind to one's favorite protein for the purpose of learning more regarding its cellular function. These same techniques, coupled with truncation and mutagenesis experiments, have been used to define the region of interaction between pairs of proteins. One conclusion from this work is that many interactions occur over short regions, often less than 10 amino acids in length within one protein. For example, mapping studies and 3-dimensional analyses of antigen-antibody interactions have revealed that epitopes are typically 4-7 residues long (1). Other examples include protein-interaction modules, such as Src homology (SH) 2 and 3 domains, phosphotyrosine binding domains (PTB), postsynaptic density/disc-large/ZO1 (PDZ) domains, WW domains, Eps15 homology (EH) domains, and 14-3-3 proteins that typically recognize linear regions of 3-9 amino acids. Each of these domains has been the subject of recent reviews published elsewhere (2 3 4 5 6 7). Among the primary structures of many ligands for protein-protein interactions, the amino acid proline is critical. In particular, SH3, WW, and several new protein-interaction domains prefer ligand sequences that are proline-rich. In addition, even though ligands for EH domains and 14-3-3 domains are not proline-rich, they do include a single proline residue. This review highlights the analysis of those protein-protein interactions that involve proline residues, the biochemistry of proline, and current drug discovery efforts based on proline peptidomimetics.-Kay, B.

@article{Bauer1993,
abstract = {Mutations in genes necessary for survival in stationary phase were isolated to understand the ability of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae to remain viable during prolonged periods of nutritional deprivation. Here we report results concerning one of these mutants, rvs167, which shows reduced viability and abnormal cell morphology upon carbon and nitrogen starvation. The mutant exhibits the same response when cells are grown in high salt concentrations and other unfavorable growth conditions. The RVS167 gene product displays significant homology with the Rvs161 protein and contains a SH3 domain at the C-terminal end. Abnormal actin distribution is associated with the mutant phenotype. In addition, while the budding pattern of haploid strains remains axial in standard growth conditions, the budding pattern of diploid mutant strains is random. The gene RVS167 therefore could be implicated in cytoskeletal reorganization in response to environmental stresses and could act in the budding site selection mechanism.},

abstract = {SH3 domains are modules of 50-70 amino acids that promote interactions among proteins, often participating in the assembly of large dynamic complexes. These domains bind to peptide ligands, which usually contain a core Pro-X-X-Pro (PXXP) sequence. Here we identify a class of SH3 domains that bind to ubiquitin. The yeast endocytic protein Sla1, as well as the mammalian proteins CIN85 and amphiphysin, carry ubiquitin-binding SH3 domains. Ubiquitin and peptide ligands bind to the same hydrophobic groove on the SH3 domain surface, and ubiquitin and a PXXP-containing protein fragment compete for binding to SH3 domains. We conclude that a subset of SH3 domains constitutes a distinct type of ubiquitin-binding domain and that ubiquitin binding can negatively regulate interaction of SH3 domains with canonical proline-rich ligands.},

@article{Verschueren2015,
abstract = {To explore the conservation of Src homology 3 (SH3) domain-mediated networks in evolution, we compared the specificity landscape of these domains among four yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ashbya gossypii, Candida albicans, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, encompassing 400 million years of evolution. We first aligned and catalogued the families of SH3-containing proteins in these four species to determine the relationships between homologous domains. Then, we tagged and purified all soluble SH3 domains (82 in total) to perform a quantitative peptide assay (SPOT) for each SH3 domain. All SPOT readouts were hierarchically clustered and we observed that the organization of the SH3 specificity landscape in three distinct profile classes remains conserved across these four yeast species. We also produced a specificity profile for each SH3 domain from manually aligned top SPOT hits and compared the within-family binding motif consensus. This analysis revealed a striking example of binding motif divergence in a C. albicans Rvs167 paralog, which cannot be explained by overall SH3 sequence or interface residue divergence, and we validated this specificity change with a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assay. In addition, we show that position-weighted matrices (PWM) compiled from SPOT assays can be used for binding motif screening in potential binding partners and present cases where motifs are either conserved or lost among homologous SH3 interacting proteins. Finally, by comparing pairwise SH3 sequence identity to binding profile correlation we show that for {\~{}}75{\%} of all analyzed families the SH3 specificity profile was remarkably conserved over a large evolutionary distance. Thus, a high sequence identity within an SH3 domain family predicts conserved binding specificity, whereas divergence in sequence identity often coincided with a change in binding specificity within this family. As such, our results are important for future studies aimed at unraveling complex specificity networks of peptide recognition domains in higher eukaryotes, including mammals.},

@article{Rao2010,
abstract = {Members of the Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain protein super-family are involved in membrane remodeling in various cellular pathways ranging from endocytic vesicle and T-tubule formation to cell migration and neuromorphogenesis. Membrane curvature induc-tion and stabilization are encoded within the BAR or Fer-CIP4 homology-BAR (F-BAR) domains, $\alpha$-helical coiled coils that dimerize into membrane-binding modules. BAR/F-BAR domain proteins often contain an SH3 domain, which recruits binding partners such as the oligomeric membrane-fissioning GTPase dynamin. How precisely BAR/F-BAR domain-mediated membrane deformation is regulated at the cellular level is unknown. Here we present the crystal structures of full-length syndapin 1 and its F-BAR domain. Our data show that syndapin 1 F-BAR-mediated membrane deformation is subject to autoinhibition by its SH3 domain. Release from the clamped confor-mation is driven by association of syndapin 1 SH3 with the proline-rich domain of dynamin 1, thereby unlocking its potent membrane-bending activity. We hypothesize that this mechanism might be com-monly used to regulate BAR/F-BAR domain-induced membrane defor-mation and to potentially couple this process to dynamin-mediated fission. Our data thus suggest a structure-based model for SH3-medi-ated regulation of BAR/F-BAR domain function. dynamin | endocytosis | membrane bending | syndapin E ukaryotic cells are characterized by a diverse array of mem-branous structures including vesicles, tubules, and pleiomorphic vacuoles that enable cellular processes such as organelle biogenesis, cell division, cell migration, secretion, and endocytosis. In most cases, dynamic membrane remodeling is accomplished by the reversible assembly of membrane-deforming proteins (1, 2), most notably by members of the Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs (BAR) domain superfamily (3). BAR domains are characterized by $\alpha$-helical coiled coils that dimerize into modules with a positively charged surface that interacts with phospholipid membranes (4, 5). Self-assembly of BAR domain proteins, often in combination with the presence of amphipathic helices (6, 7), may then induce or stabilize membrane curvature de novo. Frequently, BAR domain proteins, such as syndapin, sorting nexin 9 (8), endophilin, and amphiphysin (9), also contain an SH3 domain that serves as an interaction platform for proline-rich motif-containing proteins including the large mem-brane-fissioning GTPase dynamin (10), suggesting that membrane bending is intimately linked with GTP-hydrolysis-dependent vesicle or tubule fission (9, 11, 12). How precisely membrane deformation by BAR domain proteins is regulated at the cellular level and how this may be coupled to fission are largely unknown. Syndapins [also termed pacsins (13)] are synaptically enriched proteins of the Fer-CIP4 homology-BAR (F-BAR) subfamily of BAR domain proteins that via their SH3 domain bind to dynamin (14) and to actin regulatory proteins such as N-WASP (15) and cordon bleu (COBL) (16). The F-BAR and SH3 domains of syn-dapins are connected via a flexible linker containing NPF motifs that interact with EH domain proteins, most notably EHD1 (3, 13, 15). Knockdown of syndapin 1 causes impaired axon development and branching and leads to defects in bulk endocytosis of synaptic vesicle (SV) membranes under intense stimulation in primary neurons (17). Similar effects are observed upon perturbation of syndapin function in lamprey reticulospinal axons (18). The role of syndapin in SV recycling appears to be under tight regulatory control by stimulation-induced dephosphorylation of dynamin 1 in nerve terminals (14). Similar regulatory mechanisms must operate to control the membrane-deforming activities of other BAR domain proteins (19–21) and the consumption of membrane buds and tubules by dynamin-mediated fission (9, 12, 17). Here we show by combined structural, biochemical, and cell bio-logical analysis that syndapin 1 F-BAR-mediated membrane bend-ing is subject to autoinhibition by its SH3 domain. Release from this clamped conformation is driven by association of syndapin 1 SH3 with dynamin 1 or of a proline-rich dynamin 1-derived peptide, thereby unlocking its potent membrane-deforming activity. These data thus suggest a model for SH3-mediated regulation of BAR/F-BAR domain function.},

@article{Arold1998,
abstract = {Understanding the issue of specificity imposed in the interactions of SH3 domains has largely been addressed in studies investigating the interaction of proline-rich amino acid sequences derived from potential ligands for these domains. Although the interaction with this motif forms an essential platform in the binding of SH3 domains, in many cases little specificity is observed and the difference in affinity for so-called specific and nonspecific proline-rich sequences is not great. Furthermore, the binding interface between an SH3 domain and a protein ligand appears to encompass more interactions than are represented by that involving the proline-rich motif. Here we investigate the issue of specificity from the opposite point of view; namely, how does a ligand recognize different SH3 domains? We present the crystal structure of the unbound SH3 domain from hemopoietic cell kinase (Hck) which is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases. This structure reveals that, unlike the structures of other Src kinase SH3 domains, the RT loop region is highly mobile and lacks a network of hydrogen bonds that is elsewhere apparent. The RT loop has been shown to form a major part of the binding interface between SH3 domains and HIV-1 Nef. Thermodynamic data, derived from isothermal titration calorimetry, for the binding of Hck SH3 to HIV-1 Nef show that the binding of Hck (KD = 1.5 microM) is approximately an order of magnitude tighter than those of other Src family kinases that were investigated (Fyn, Lck, and Src). This increase in affinity is attributed to, among other effects, the inherent flexibility in the RT loop which does not require breaking the network of hydrogen bonds to adopt the conformation required for binding.},

abstract = {Background: WASp family proteins promote actin filament assembly by activating Arp2/3 complex and are regulated spatially and temporally to assemble specialized actin structures used in diverse cellular processes. Some WASp family members are autoinhibited until bound by activating ligands; however, regulation of the budding yeast WASp homolog (Las17/Bee1) has not yet been explored.
Results: We isolated full-length Las17 and characterized its biochemical activities on yeast Arp2/3 complex. Purified Las17 was not autoinhibited; in this respect, it is more similar to SCAR/WAVE than to WASp proteins. Las17 was a much stronger activator of Arp2/3 complex than its carboxyl-terminal (WA) fragment. In addition, actin polymerization stimulated by Las17-Arp2/3 was much less sensitive to the inhibitory effects of profilin compared to polymerization stimulated by WA-Arp2/3. Two SH3 domain-containing binding partners of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, were purified and were shown to cooperate in inhibiting Las17 activity. The two SLA1 SH3 domains required for this inhibitory activity in vitro were also required in vivo, in combination with BBC1, for cell viability and normal actin organization.
Conclusions: Full-length Las17 is not autoinhibited and activates Arp2/3 complex more strongly than its WA domain alone, revealing an important role for the Las17 amino terminus in Arp2/3 complex activation. Two of the SH3 domain-containing ligands of Las17, Sla1 and Bbc1, cooperate to inhibit Las17 activity in vitro and are required for a shared function in actin organization in vivo. Our results show that, like SCAR/WAVE, WASp proteins can be controlled by negative regulation through the combined actions of multiple ligands.},

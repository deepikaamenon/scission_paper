abstract = {Dynamin 1 is a neuron-specific guanosine triphosphatase thought to be critically required for the fission reaction of synaptic vesicle endocytosis. Unexpectedly, mice lacking dynamin 1 were able to form functional synapses, even though their postnatal viability was limited. However, during spontaneous network activity, branched, tubular plasma membrane invaginations accumulated, capped by clathrin-coated pits, in synapses of dynamin 1-knockout mice. Synaptic vesicle endocytosis was severely impaired during strong exogenous stimulation but resumed efficiently when the stimulus was terminated. Thus, dynamin 1-independent mechanisms can support limited synaptic vesicle endocytosis, but dynamin 1 is needed during high levels of neuronal activity.},

@article{Shpetner1989,
abstract = {We report that calf brain microtubules prepared without nucleotide contain, in addition to kinesin and dynein, a polypeptide of 100 kd that could be dissociated by nucleotide. The protein was selectively extracted from microtubules using a combination of GTP and AMP-PNP. The extract contained microtubule-stimulated (6-fold) MgATPase activity that partitioned into two components upon further purification: the 100 kd polypeptide and a soluble activating fraction. The 100 kd protein induced microtubules to form hexagonally packed bundles containing periodic cross bridges spaced 13 nm apart. In the presence of ATP and the activating fraction, bundles fragmented, elongated, and exhibited other behavior indicative of sliding between microtubules. These findings indicate that the 100 kd protein is part of a novel mechanochemical enzyme, which we term "dynamin", that may mediate microtubule sliding in vivo.},

@article{Colwill1999,
abstract = {Morphological changes during cell division in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are controlled by cell-cycle regulators. The Pcl-Pho85p kinase complex has been implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton at least in part through Rvs167p. Rvs167p consists of three domains called BAR, GPA, and SH3. Using a two-hybrid assay, we demonstrated that each region of Rvs167p participates in protein-protein interactions: the BAR domain bound the BAR domain of another Rvs167p protein and that of Rvs161p, the GPA region bound Pcl2p, and the SH3 domain bound Abp1p. We identified Rvs167p as a Las17p/Bee1p-interacting protein in a two-hybrid screen and showed that Las17p/Bee1p bound the SH3 domain of Rvs167p. We tested the extent to which the Rvs167p protein domains rescued phenotypes associated with deletion of RVS167: salt sensitivity, random budding, and endocytosis and sporulation defects. The BAR domain was sufficient for full or partial rescue of all rvs167 mutant phenotypes tested but not required for the sporulation defect for which the SH3 domain was also sufficient. Overexpression of Rvs167p inhibits cell growth. The BAR domain was essential for this inhibition and the SH3 domain had only a minor effect. Rvs167p may link the cell cycle regulator Pcl-Pho85p kinase and the actin cytoskeleton. We propose that Rvs167p is activated by phosphorylation in its GPA region by the Pcl-Pho85p kinase. Upon activation, Rvs167p enters a multiprotein complex, making critical contacts in its BAR domain and redundant or minor contacts with its SH3 domain.},

@article{Grassart2014,
abstract = {Clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) involves the recruitment of numerous proteins to sites on the plasma membrane with prescribed timing to mediate specific stages of the process. However, how choreographed recruitment and function of specific proteins during CME is achieved remains unclear. Using genome editing to express fluorescent fusion proteins at native levels and live-cell imaging with single-molecule sensitivity, we explored dynamin2 stoichiometry, dynamics, and functional interdependency with actin. Our quantitative analyses revealed heterogeneity in the timing of the early phase of CME, with transient recruitment of 2-4 molecules of dynamin2. In contrast, considerable regularity characterized the final 20 s of CME, during which ∼26 molecules of dynamin2, sufficient to make one ring around the vesicle neck, were typically recruited. Actin assembly generally preceded dynamin2 recruitment during the late phases of CME, and promoted dynamin recruitment. Collectively, our results demonstrate precise temporal and quantitative regulation of the dynamin2 recruitment influenced by actin polymerization.},

@article{Sweitzer1998,
abstract = {The dynamin family of GTPases is essential for receptor-mediated endocytosis and synaptic vesicle recycling, and it has recently been shown to play a role in vesicle formation from the trans–Golgi network. Dynamin is believed to assemble around the necks of clathrin-coated pits and assist in pinching vesicles from the plasma membrane. This role would make dynamin unique among GTPases in its ability to act as a mechanochemical enzyme. Data presented here demonstrate that purified recombinant dynamin binds to a lipid bilayer in a regular pattern to form helical tubes that constrict and vesiculate upon GTP addition. This suggests that dynamin alone is sufficient for the formation of constricted necks of coated pits and supports the hypothesis that dynamin is the force-generating molecule responsible for membrane fission.},

@article{Kaksonen2003,
abstract = {In budding yeast, many proteins involved in endocytic internalization, including adaptors and actin cytoskeletal proteins, are localized to cortical patches of differing protein composition. Using multicolor real-time fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking algorithms, we define an early endocytic pathway wherein an invariant sequence of changes in cortical patch protein composition correlates with changes in patch motility. Three Arp2/3 activators each showed a distinct behavior, suggesting distinct patch-related endocytic functions. Actin polymerization occurs late in the endocytic pathway and is required both for endocytic internalization and for patch disassembly. In cells lacking the highly conserved endocytic protein Sla2p, patch motility was arrested and actin comet tails associated with endocytic patch complexes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of the actin comet tails revealed that endocytic complexes are nucleation sites for rapid actin polymerization. Attention is now focused on the mechanisms by which the order and timing of events in this endocytic pathway are achieved.},

@article{Kanaseki1969,
abstract = {Five points are discussed regarding the vesicular structure isolated by fractionation techniques from the brain and liver of the guinea pig. 1. One type of vesicle, fixed by OsO(4) and shown in thin sections, is identified with the coated vesicle that has been observed in many varieties of tissues. 2. The vesicle contained in a spherical polygonal "basketwork" shown by the negative-staining techniques is identical with the coated vesicle shown in sections. 3. Despite minute observation of this basketwork we could not confirm the existence of "hairlike projections" extending from the convex cytoplasmic surface of the vesicle. We are inclined to believe, therefore, that the hairlike projections are actually the superimposed visual images of the regular hexagons and pentagons of the network composing the basketwork. 4. We repeat the hypothesis originally advanced by Roth and Porter (1) that the "coating" of the coated vesicle plays a role in the mechanism of the infolding and fission of the membrane; we suggest that these events are caused by the transformation of the regular hexagons (of the coating) into regular pentagons. 5. Finally, we make a suggestion as to the nature of those vesicles which have on their surface subparticles which look like "elementary particles (2)."},

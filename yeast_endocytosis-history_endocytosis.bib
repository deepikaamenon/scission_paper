@article{Kanaseki1969,
abstract = {Five points are discussed regarding the vesicular structure isolated by fractionation techniques from the brain and liver of the guinea pig. 1. One type of vesicle, fixed by OsO(4) and shown in thin sections, is identified with the coated vesicle that has been observed in many varieties of tissues. 2. The vesicle contained in a spherical polygonal "basketwork" shown by the negative-staining techniques is identical with the coated vesicle shown in sections. 3. Despite minute observation of this basketwork we could not confirm the existence of "hairlike projections" extending from the convex cytoplasmic surface of the vesicle. We are inclined to believe, therefore, that the hairlike projections are actually the superimposed visual images of the regular hexagons and pentagons of the network composing the basketwork. 4. We repeat the hypothesis originally advanced by Roth and Porter (1) that the "coating" of the coated vesicle plays a role in the mechanism of the infolding and fission of the membrane; we suggest that these events are caused by the transformation of the regular hexagons (of the coating) into regular pentagons. 5. Finally, we make a suggestion as to the nature of those vesicles which have on their surface subparticles which look like "elementary particles (2)."},

@article{Kaksonen2003b,
abstract = {In budding yeast, many proteins involved in endocytic internalization, including adaptors and actin cytoskeletal proteins, are localized to cortical patches of differing protein composition. Using multicolor real-time fluorescence microscopy and particle tracking algorithms, we define an early endocytic pathway wherein an invariant sequence of changes in cortical patch protein composition correlates with changes in patch motility. Three Arp2/3 activators each showed a distinct behavior, suggesting distinct patch-related endocytic functions. Actin polymerization occurs late in the endocytic pathway and is required both for endocytic internalization and for patch disassembly. In cells lacking the highly conserved endocytic protein Sla2p, patch motility was arrested and actin comet tails associated with endocytic patch complexes. Fluorescence recovery after photobleaching of the actin comet tails revealed that endocytic complexes are nucleation sites for rapid actin polymerization. Attention is now focused on the mechanisms by which the order and timing of events in this endocytic pathway are achieved.},

@article{Shpetner1989,
abstract = {We report that calf brain microtubules prepared without nucleotide contain, in addition to kinesin and dynein, a polypeptide of 100 kd that could be dissociated by nucleotide. The protein was selectively extracted from microtubules using a combination of GTP and AMP-PNP. The extract contained microtubule-stimulated (6-fold) MgATPase activity that partitioned into two components upon further purification: the 100 kd polypeptide and a soluble activating fraction. The 100 kd protein induced microtubules to form hexagonally packed bundles containing periodic cross bridges spaced 13 nm apart. In the presence of ATP and the activating fraction, bundles fragmented, elongated, and exhibited other behavior indicative of sliding between microtubules. These findings indicate that the 100 kd protein is part of a novel mechanochemical enzyme, which we term "dynamin", that may mediate microtubule sliding in vivo.},

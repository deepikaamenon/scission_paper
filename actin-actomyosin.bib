abstract = {The motion of many intracellular pathogens is driven by the polymerization of actin filaments. The propulsive force developed by the polymerization process is thought to arise from the thermal motions of the polymerizing filament tips. Recent experiments suggest that the nucleation of actin filaments involves a phase when the filaments are attached to the pathogen surface by a protein complex. Here we extend the "elastic ratchet model" of Mogilner and Oster to incorporate these new findings. We apply this "tethered ratchet" model to derive the force-velocity relation for Listeria and discuss relations of our theoretical predictions to experimental measurements. We also discuss "symmetry breaking" dynamics observed in ActA-coated bead experiments, and the implications of the model for lamellipodial protrusion in migrating cells.},

@article{Theriot1992,
abstract = {THE Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen capable of rapid movement through the host cell cytoplasm1. The biophysical basis of the motility of L. monocytogenes is an interesting question in its own right, the answer to which may shed light on the general processes of actin-based motility in cells. Moving intracellular bacteria display phase-dense 'comet tails' made of actin filaments, the formation of which is required for bacterial motility2,3. We have investigated the dynamics of the actin filaments in the comet tails using the technique of photoactivation of fluorescence, which allows monitoring of the movement and turnover of labelled actin filaments after activation by illumination with ultraviolet light. We find that the actin filaments remain stationary in the cytoplasm as the bacterium moves forward, and that length of the comet tails is linearly proportional to the rate of movement. Our results imply that the motile mechanism involves continuous polymerization and release of actin filaments at the bacterial surface and that the rate of filament generation is related to the rate of movement. We suggest that actin polymerization provides the driving force for bacterial propulsion. {\textcopyright} 1992 Nature Publishing Group.},

@article{Li2018,
abstract = {The actin cytoskeleton and actin-coupled endocytosis are conserved cellular processes required for the normal growth and pathogenesis of the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We have previously shown that both actin-regulating kinase MoArk1 and adenylyl cyclase-associated protein MoCap1 regulate actin dynamics and endocytosis to play a key role in virulence of the fungus. To understand the underlying mechanism, we have characterized the actin-binding protein MoAbp1 that interacts with MoArk1 from M. oryzae. The $\Delta$Moabp1 mutant exhibited delayed endocytosis and defects in the growth, host penetration, and invasive growth. Consistent with its putative function associated with actin-binding, MoAbp1 regulates the localization of actin patches and plays a role in MoArk1 phosphorylation. In addition, MoAbp1 interacts with MoCap1 affecting its normal patch localization pattern and the actin protein MoAct1 through its conserved domains. Taken together, our results support a notion that MoAbp1 functions as a protein scaffold linking MoArk1, MoCap1 and MoAct1 to regulate actin cytoskeleton dynamics critical in growth and pathogenicity of the blast fungus.},

@article{Geli2000,
abstract = {The yeast type I myosins (MYO3 and MYO5) are involved in endocytosis and in the polarization of the actin cytoskeleton. The tail of these proteins contains a Tail Homology 2 (TH2) domain that constitutes a putative actin-binding site. Because of the important mechanistic implications of a second ATP-independent actin-binding site, we analyzed its functional relevance in vivo. Even though the myosin tail interacts with actin, and this interaction seems functionally important, deletion of a major portion of the TH2 domain did not abolish interaction. In contrast, we found that the SH3 domain of Myo5p significantly contributes to this interaction, implicating other proteins. We found that Vrp1p, the yeast homolog of WIP [Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP)-interacting protein], seems necessary to sustain the Myo5p tail-F-actin interaction. Consistent with recent results implicating the yeast type I myosins in regulating actin polymerization in vivo, we demonstrate that the C-terminal domain of Myo5p is able to induce cytosol-dependent actin polymerization in vitro, and that this activity requires both an intact Myo5p SH3 domain and Vrp1p.},

@techreport{Tilney,
abstract = {After Listeria, a bacterium, is phagocytosed by a macrophage, it dissolves the phagosomal membrane and enters the cytoplasm. The Listeria then nu-cleates actin filaments from its surface. These newly assembled actin filaments show unidirectional polarity with their barbed ends associated with the surface of the Listeria. Using actin concentrations below the pointed end critical concentration we find that filament elongation must be occurring by monomers adding to the barbed ends, the ends associated with the Listerial surface. If Listeria with tails are incubated in G actin under polymerizing conditions, the Listeria is translo-cated away from its preformed tail by the elongation of filaments attached to the Listeria. This experiment and others tell us that in vivo filament assembly must be tightly coupled to filament capping and cross-bridging so that if one process outstrips another, chaos ensues. We also show that the actin filaments in the tail are capped on their pointed ends which inhibits further elongation and/or disassembly in vitro. From these re-suits we suggest a simple picture of how Listeria competes effectively for host cell actin. When Listeria secretes a nucleator, the host's actin subunits polymerize into a filament. Host cell machinery terminate the assembly leaving a short filament. Listeria overcomes the host control by nucleating new filaments and thus many short filaments assemble. The newest filaments push existing ones into a growing tail. Thus the competition is between nucleation of filaments caused by Listeria and the filament terminators produced by the host.},

@article{Sun2006,
abstract = {Actin polymerization essential for endocytic internalization in budding yeast is controlled by four nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) that each exhibits a unique dynamic behavior at endocytic sites. How each NPF functions and is regulated to restrict actin assembly to late stages of endocytic internalization is not known. Quantitative analysis of NPF biochemical activities, and genetic analysis of recruitment and regulatory mechanisms, defined a linear pathway in which protein composition changes at endocytic sites control actin assembly and function. We show that yeast WASP initiates actin assembly at endocytic sites and that this assembly and the recruitment of a yeast WIP-like protein by WASP recruit a type I myosin with both NPF and motor activities. Importantly, type I myosin motor and NPF activities are separable, and both contribute to endocytic coat inward movement, which likely represents membrane invagination. These results reveal a mechanism in which actin nucleation and myosin motor activity cooperate to promote endocytic internalization.},
